The most controversial, and least scientifically valid, part of Freudian theory is its explanations of
personality development. Freud argued that personality is developed through a series of psychosexual
stages, each focusing on pleasure from a different part of the body (Table 11.5 “Freud’s Stages of
Psychosexual Development”). Freud believed that sexuality begins in infancy, and that the appropriate
resolution of each stage has implications for later personality development.

In the first of Freud’s proposed stages of psychosexual development, which begins at birth and lasts
until about 18 months of age, the focus is on the mouth. During this oral stage, the infant obtains sexual
pleasure by sucking and drinking. Infants who receive either too little or too much gratification become
fixated or “locked” in the oral stage, and are likely to regress to these points of fixation under stress, even
as adults. According to Freud, a child who receives too little oral gratification (e.g., who was underfed
or neglected) will become orally dependent as an adult and be likely to manipulate others to fulfill his
or her needs rather than becoming independent. On the other hand, the child who was overfed or overly
gratified will resist growing up and try to return to the prior state of dependency by acting helpless,
demanding satisfaction from others, and acting in a needy way.
The anal stage, lasting from about 18 months to 3 years of age is when children first experience
psychological conflict. During this stage children desire to experience pleasure through bowel
movements, but they are also being toilet trained to delay this gratification. Freud believed that if this
toilet training was either too harsh or too lenient, children would become fixated in the anal stage
and become likely to regress to this stage under stress as adults. If the child received too little anal
gratification (i.e., if the parents had been very harsh about toilet training), the adult personality will be
anal retentive—stingy, with a compulsive seeking of order and tidiness. On the other hand, if the parents
had been too lenient, the anal expulsive personality results, characterized by a lack of self-control and a
tendency toward messiness and carelessness.

The phallic stage, which lasts from age 3 to age 6 is when the penis (for boys) and clitoris (for girls)
become the primary erogenous zone for sexual pleasure. During this stage, Freud believed that children
develop a powerful but unconscious attraction for the opposite-sex parent, as well as a desire to eliminate
the same-sex parent as a rival. Freud based his theory of sexual development in boys (the “Oedipus
complex”) on the Greek mythological character Oedipus, who unknowingly killed his father and married
his mother, and then put his own eyes out when he learned what he had done. Freud argued that boys will
normally eventually abandon their love of the mother, and instead identify with the father, also taking
on the father’s personality characteristics, but that boys who do not successfully resolve the Oedipus
complex will experience psychological problems later in life. Although it was not as important in Freud’s
theorizing, in girls the phallic stage is often termed the “Electra complex,” after the Greek character who
avenged her father’s murder by killing her mother. Freud believed that girls frequently experienced penis
envy, the sense of deprivation supposedly experienced by girls because they do not have a penis.
The latency stage is a period of relative calm that lasts from about 6 years to 12 years. During this time,
Freud believed that sexual impulses were repressed, leading boys and girls to have little or no interest in
members of the opposite sex.
The fifth and last stage, the genital stage, begins about 12 years of age and lasts into adulthood.
According to Freud, sexual impulses return during this time frame, and if development has proceeded
normally to this point, the child is able to move into the development of mature romantic relationships.
But if earlier problems have not been appropriately resolved, difficulties with establishing intimate love
attachments are likely.
