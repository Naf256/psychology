In an effort to make the list of traits more manageable, Raymond Cattell (1946, 1957) narrowed down
the list to about 171 traits. However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately
reflect a personâ€™s uniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we
differ only in the degree to which each trait is expressed. Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions
of personality: warmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social
boldness, sensitivity, vigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-
reliance, perfectionism, and tension (Table 11.5). He developed a personality assessment based on these
16 factors, called the 16PF. Instead of a trait being present or absent, each dimension is scored over a
continuum, from high to low. For example, your level of warmth describes how warm, caring, and nice to
others you are. If you score low on this index, you tend to be more distant and cold. A high score on this
index signifies you are supportive and comforting.
