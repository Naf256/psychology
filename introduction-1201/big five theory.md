While Cattell’s 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck’s two-factor system has been criticized for
being too narrow. Another personality theory, called the Five Factor Model, effectively hits a middle
ground, with its five factors referred to as the Big Five personality factors. It is the most popular theory
in personality psychology today and the most accurate approximation of the basic personality dimensions
(Funder, 2001). The five factors are openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness,
and neuroticism (Figure 11.14). A helpful way to remember the factors is by using the mnemonic OCEAN.

In the Five Factor Model, each person has each factor, but they occur along a spectrum. Openness to
experience is characterized by imagination, feelings, actions, and ideas. People who score high on this
factor tend to be curious and have a wide range of interests. Conscientiousness is characterized by
competence, self-discipline, thoughtfulness, and achievement-striving (goal-directed behavior). People
who score high on this factor are hardworking and dependable. Numerous studies have found a positive
correlation between conscientiousness and academic success (Akomolafe, 2013; Chamorro-Premuzic &
Furnham, 2008; Conrad & Patry, 2012; Noftle & Robins, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, 2007). Extroversion
is characterized by sociability, assertiveness, excitement-seeking, and emotional expression. People who
score high on this factor are usually described as outgoing and warm. Not surprisingly, people who
score high on both extroversion and openness are more likely to participate in adventure and risky sports
due to their curious and excitement-seeking nature (Tok, 2011). The fourth factor is agreeableness, which
is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy, and good-natured. People who score low on
agreeableness tend to be described as rude and uncooperative, yet one recent study reported that men
who scored low on this factor actually earned more money than men who were considered more agreeable

The last of the Big Five factors is neuroticism, which is the tendency to
experience negative emotions. People high on neuroticism tend to experience emotional instability and are
characterized as angry, impulsive, and hostile. Watson and Clark (1984) found that people reporting high
levels of neuroticism also tend to report feeling anxious and unhappy. In contrast, people who score low
in neuroticism tend to be calm and even-tempered.

The Big Five personality factors each represent a range between two extremes. In reality, most of us tend
to lie somewhere midway along the continuum of each factor, rather than at polar ends. It’s important
to note that the Big Five factors are relatively stable over our lifespan, with some tendency for the
factors to increase or decrease slightly. Researchers have found that conscientiousness increases through
young adulthood into middle age, as we become better able to manage our personal relationships and
careers (Donnellan & Lucas, 2008). Agreeableness also increases with age, peaking between 50 to 70 years
(Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, & Costa, 2005). Neuroticism and extroversion tend to decline slightly with
age (Donnellan & Lucas; Terracciano et al.). Additionally, The Big Five factors have been shown to exist
across ethnicities, cultures, and ages, and may have substantial biological and genetic components
