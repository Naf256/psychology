One of the most widely used personality inventories is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory
(MMPI), first published in 1943, with 504 true/false questions, and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with
567 questions. The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota
farmers and psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national
sample to allow for better standardization. The MMPI-2 takes 1–2 hours to complete. Responses are scored
to produce a clinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic
deviance (social deviance), masculinity versus femininity, paranoia, psychasthenia (obsessive/compulsive
qualities), schizophrenia, hypomania, and social introversion. There is also a scale to ascertain risk factors
for alcohol abuse. In 2008, the test was again revised, using more advanced methods, to the MMPI-2-RF.
This version takes about one-half the time to complete and has only 338 questions (Figure 11.17). Despite
the new test’s advantages, the MMPI-2 is more established and is still more widely used. Typically,
the tests are administered by computer. Although the MMPI was originally developed to assist in the
clinical diagnosis of psychological disorders, it is now also used for occupational screening, such as in law
enforcement, and in college, career, and marital counseling (Ben-Porath & Tellegen, 2008).

In addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales. (Recall the concepts of
reliability and validity from your study of psychological research.) One of the validity scales, the Lie
Scale (or “L” Scale), consists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is “faking good”
(underreporting psychological problems to appear healthier). For example, if someone responds “yes” to
a number of unrealistically positive items such as “I have never told a lie,” they may be trying to “fake
good” or appear better than they actually are.
Reliability scales test an instrument’s consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today
and then again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar. Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave
the MMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later. After 2 years
on the job, police officers’ responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms
(vague, unexplained physical complaints), and anxiety. When the test was given an additional 2 years later
(4 years after starting on the job), the results suggested high risk for alcohol-related difficulties.
