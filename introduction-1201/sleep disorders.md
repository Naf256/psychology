According to a recent poll (National Sleep Foundation, 2009), about one-fourth of American adults say
they get a good night’s sleep only a few nights a month or less. These people are suffering from a sleep
disorder known as insomnia, defined as persistent difficulty falling or staying asleep. Most cases of
insomnia are temporary, lasting from a few days to several weeks, but in some cases insomnia can last
for years.
Insomnia can result from physical disorders such as pain due to injury or illness, or from psychological
problems such as stress, financial worries, or relationship difficulties. Changes in sleep patterns, such
as jet lag, changes in work shift, or even the movement to or from daylight savings time can produce
insomnia. Sometimes the sleep that the insomniac does get is disturbed and nonrestorative, and the lack
of quality sleep produces impairment of functioning during the day. Ironically, the problem may be
compounded by people’s anxiety over insomnia itself: Their fear of being unable to sleep may wind up
keeping them awake. Some people may also develop a conditioned anxiety to the bedroom or the bed.
People who have difficulty sleeping may turn to drugs to help them sleep. Barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
and other sedatives are frequently marketed and prescribed as sleep aids, but they may interrupt the
natural stages of the sleep cycle, and in the end are likely to do more harm than good. In some
cases they may also promote dependence. Most practitioners of sleep medicine today recommend
making environmental and scheduling changes first, followed by therapy for underlying problems, with
pharmacological remedies used only as a last resort.

According to the National Sleep Foundation, some steps that can be used to combat insomnia include
the following:
• Use the bed and bedroom for sleep and sex only. Do not spend time in bed during the day.
• Establish a regular bedtime routine and a regular sleep-wake schedule.
• Think positively about your sleeping—try not to get anxious just because you are losing a
little sleep.
• Do not eat or drink too much close to bedtime.
• Create a sleep-promoting environment that is dark, cool, and comfortable.
• Avoid disturbing noises—consider a bedside fan or white-noise machine to block out
disturbing sounds.
• Consume less or no caffeine, particularly late in the day.
• Avoid alcohol and nicotine, especially close to bedtime.
• Exercise, but not within 3 hours before bedtime.
• Avoid naps, particularly in the late afternoon or evening.
• Keep a sleep diary to identify your sleep habits and patterns that you can share with your
doctor.

Another common sleep problem is sleep apnea, a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing
that last at least 10 seconds during sleep (Morgenthaler, Kagramanov, Hanak, & Decker, 2006). In
addition to preventing restorative sleep, sleep apnea can also cause high blood pressure and may raise
the risk of stroke and heart attack (Yaggi et al., 2005).
Most sleep apnea is caused by an obstruction of the walls of the throat that occurs when we fall asleep.
It is most common in obese or older individuals who have lost muscle tone and is particularly common
in men. Sleep apnea caused by obstructions is usually treated with an air machine that uses a mask to
create a continuous pressure that prevents the airway from collapsing, or with mouthpieces that keep
the airway open. If all other treatments have failed, sleep apnea may be treated with surgery to open the
airway.

Sleep terrors is a disruptive sleep disorder, most frequently experienced in childhood, that may involve
loud screams and intense panic. The sufferer cannot wake from sleep even though he or she is trying
to. In extreme cases, sleep terrors may result in bodily harm or property damage as the sufferer moves
about abruptly. Up to 3% of adults suffer from sleep terrors, which typically occur in sleep stage N3
(Mahowald & Schenck, 2000).
