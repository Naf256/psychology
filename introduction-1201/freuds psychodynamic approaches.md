One of the most important psychological approaches to understanding personality is based on the
theorizing of the Austrian physician and psychologist Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), who founded what
today is known as the psychodynamic approach to understanding personality. Many people know
about Freud because his work has had a huge impact on our everyday thinking about psychology,
and the psychodynamic approach is one of the most important approaches to psychological therapy
(Roudinesco, 2003; Taylor, 2009). Freud is probably the best known of all psychologists, in part because
of his impressive observation and analyses of personality (there are 24 volumes of his writings). As is
true of all theories, many of Freud’s ingenious ideas have turned out to be at least partially incorrect, and
yet other aspects of his theories are still influencing psychology.
Freud was influenced by the work of the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893), who
had been interviewing patients (almost all women) who were experiencing what was at the time known
as hysteria. Although it is no longer used to describe a psychological disorder, hysteria at the time
referred to a set of personality and physical symptoms that included chronic pain, fainting, seizures, and
paralysis.
Charcot could find no biological reason for the symptoms. For instance, some women experienced a loss
of feeling in their hands and yet not in their arms, and this seemed impossible given that the nerves in
the arms are the same that are in the hands. Charcot was experimenting with the use of hypnosis, and
he and Freud found that under hypnosis many of the hysterical patients reported, having reported traumatic sexual experience such as sexual abuse as a child.

Freud and Charcot also found that during hypnosis the remembering of the trauma was often
accompanied by an outpouring of emotion, known as catharsis, and that following the catharsis the
patient’s symptoms were frequently reduced in severity. These observations led Freud and Charcot to
conclude that these disorders were caused by psychological rather than physiological factors.
Freud used the observations that he and Charcot had made to develop his theory regarding the sources of
personality and behavior, and his insights are central to the fundamental themes of psychology. In terms
of free will, Freud did not believe that we were able to control our own behaviors. Rather, he believed
that all behaviors are predetermined by motivations that lie outside our awareness, in the unconscious.
These forces show themselves in our dreams, in neurotic symptoms such as obsessions, while we are
under hypnosis, and in Freudian “slips of the tongue” in which people reveal their unconscious desires
in language. Freud argued that we rarely understand why we do what we do, although we can make
up explanations for our behaviors after the fact. For Freud the mind was like an iceberg, with the
many motivations of the unconscious being much larger, but also out of sight, in comparison to the
consciousness of which we are aware.
