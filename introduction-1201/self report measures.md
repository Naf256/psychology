Self-report inventories are a kind of objective test used to assess personality. They typically use multiple-
choice items or numbered scales, which represent a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
They often are called Likert scales after their developer, Rensis Likert (1932) (Figure 11.16). Self-report
inventories are generally easy to administer and cost effective. There is also an increased likelihood of test
takers being inclined to answer in ways that are intentionally or unintentionally more socially desirable,
exaggerated, biased, or misleading. For example, someone applying for a job will likely try to present
themselves in a positive light, perhaps as an even better candidate than they actually are.
