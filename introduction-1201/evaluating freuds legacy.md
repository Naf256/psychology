Freud has probably exerted a greater impact on the public’s understanding of personality than any other
thinker, and he has also in large part defined the field of psychology. Although Freudian psychologists
no longer talk about oral, anal, or genital “fixations,” they do continue to believe that our childhood
experiences and unconscious motivations shape our personalities and our attachments with others, and
they still make use of psychodynamic concepts when they conduct psychological therapy.
Nevertheless, Freud’s theories, as well as those of the neo-Freudians, have in many cases failed to pass
the test of empiricism, and as a result they are less influential now than they have been in the past
(Crews, 1998). The problems are first, that it has proved to be difficult to rigorously test Freudian theory
because the predictions that it makes (particularly those regarding defense mechanisms) are often vague
and unfalsifiable, and second, that the aspects of the theory that can be tested often have not received
much empirical support.
As examples, although Freud claimed that children exposed to overly harsh toilet training would
become fixated in the anal stage and thus be prone to excessive neatness, stinginess, and stubbornness
in adulthood, research has found few reliable associations between toilet training practices and adult
personality (Fisher & Greenberg, 1996). And since the time of Freud, the need to repress sexual desires
would seem to have become much less necessary as societies have tolerated a wider variety of sexual
practices. And yet the psychological disorders that Freud thought we caused by this repression have not
decreased.

There is also little scientific support for most of the Freudian defense mechanisms. For example, studies
have failed to yield evidence for the existence of repression. People who are exposed to traumatic
experiences in war have been found to remember their traumas only too well (Kihlstrom, 1997).
Although we may attempt to push information that is anxiety-arousing into our unconscious, this often
has the ironic effect of making us think about the information even more strongly than if we hadn’t
tried to repress it (Newman, Duff, & Baumeister, 1997). It is true that children remember little of their
childhood experiences, but this seems to be true of both negative as well as positive experiences, is
true for animals as well, and probably is better explained in terms of the brain’s inability to form long-
term memories than in terms of repression. On the other hand, Freud’s important idea that expressing or
talking through one’s difficulties can be psychologically helpful has been supported in current research
(Baddeley & Pennebaker, 2009) and has become a mainstay of psychological therapy.
A particular problem for testing Freudian theories is that almost anything that conflicts with a prediction
based in Freudian theory can be explained away in terms of the use of a defense mechanism. A man
who expresses a lot of anger toward his father may be seen via Freudian theory to be experiencing
the Oedipus complex, which includes conflict with the father. But a man who expresses no anger at
all toward the father also may be seen as experiencing the Oedipus complex by repressing the anger.
Because Freud hypothesized that either was possible, but did not specify when repression would or
would not occur, the theory is difficult to falsify.
In terms of the important role of the unconscious, Freud seems to have been at least in part correct.

More and more research demonstrates that a large part of everyday behavior is driven by processes that
are outside our conscious awareness (Kihlstrom, 1987). And yet, although our unconscious motivations
influence every aspect of our learning and behavior Freud probably overestimated the extent to which
these unconscious motivations are primarily sexual and aggressive.

Taken together, it is fair to say that Freudian theory, like most psychological theories, was not entirely
correct and that it has had to be modified over time as the results of new studies have become available.
But the fundamental ideas about personality that Freud proposed, as well as the use of talk therapy as an
essential component of therapy, are nevertheless still a major part of psychology and are used by clinical
psychologists every day.
