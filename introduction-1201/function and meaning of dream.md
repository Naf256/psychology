Dreams are the succession of images, thoughts, sounds, and emotions that passes through our minds
while sleeping. When people are awakened from REM sleep, they normally report that they have
been dreaming, suggesting that people normally dream several times a night but that most dreams are
forgotten on awakening (Dement, 1997). The content of our dreams generally relates to our everyday
experiences and concerns, and frequently our fears and failures (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, &
Friedman, 2006; Domhoff, Meyer-Gomes, & Schredl, 2005).
Many cultures regard dreams as having great significance for the dreamer, either by revealing something
important about the dreamer’s present circumstances or predicting his future. The Austrian psychologist
Sigmund Freud (1913/1988) analyzed the dreams of his patients to help him understand their
unconscious needs and desires, and psychotherapists still make use of this technique today. Freud
believed that the primary function of dreams was wish fulfillment, or the idea that dreaming allows us to
act out the desires that we must repress during the day. He differentiated between the manifest content
of the dream (i.e., its literal actions) and its latent content (i.e., the hidden psychological meaning of the
dream). Freud believed that the real meaning of dreams is often suppressed by the unconscious mind
in order to protect the individual from thoughts and feelings that are hard to cope with. By uncovering
the real meaning of dreams through psychoanalysis, Freud believed that people could better understand
their problems and resolve the issues that create difficulties in their lives.
Although Freud and others have focused on the meaning of dreams, other theories about the causes of
dreams are less concerned with their content. One possibility is that we dream primarily to help with
consolidation, or the moving of information into long-term memory (Alvarenga et al., 2008; Zhang
(2004). Rauchs, Desgranges, Foret, and Eustache (2005) found that rats that had been deprived of REM
sleep after learning a new task were less able to perform the task again later than were rats that had been
allowed to dream, and these differences were greater on tasks that involved learning unusual information
or developing new behaviors. Payne and Nadel (2004) argued that the content of dreams is the result of
consolidation—we dream about the things that are being moved into long-term memory. Thus dreaming
may be an important part of the learning that we do while sleeping (Hobson, Pace-Schott, and Stickgold,
2000).
The activation-synthesis theory of dreaming (Hobson & McCarley, 1977; Hobson, 2004) proposes still
another explanation for dreaming—namely, that dreams are our brain’s interpretation of the random
firing of neurons in the brain stem. According to this approach, the signals from the brain stem are sent
to the cortex, just as they are when we are awake, but because the pathways from the cortex to skeletal
muscles are disconnected during REM sleep, the cortex does not know how to interpret the signals. As
a result, the cortex strings the messages together into the coherent stories we experience as dreams.
Although researchers are still trying to determine the exact causes of dreaming, one thing remains
clear—we need to dream. If we are deprived of REM sleep, we quickly become less able to engage in
the important tasks of everyday life, until we are finally able to dream again.
