A problem-solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different
action plans associated with them (Table 7.2). For example, a well-known strategy is trial and error. The
old adage, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” describes trial and error. In terms of your broken
printer, you could try checking the ink levels, and if that doesn’t work, you could check to make sure the
paper tray isn’t jammed. Or maybe the printer isn’t actually connected to your laptop. When using trial
and error, you would continue to try different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and
error is not typically one of the most time-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.

Another type of strategy is an algorithm. An algorithm is a problem-solving formula that provides you
with step-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Kahneman, 2011). You can think of an
algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are
performed. Algorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When
you run a search on the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will
appear first in your list of results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your
newsfeed. Can you identify other situations in which algorithms are used?
A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy. While an algorithm must be followed exactly
to produce a correct result, a heuristic is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky & Kahneman,
1974). You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A “rule of thumb” is an
example of a heuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite
its time-saving characteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different
types of heuristics are used in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when
one of five conditions is met (Pratkanis, 1989):
• When one is faced with too much information
• When the time to make a decision is limited
• When the decision to be made is unimportant
• When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision
• When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same moment
Working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end
result. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM
on Saturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that Interstate 95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to
plan your route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM,
and it takes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You
use the working backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without
even thinking about it.
Another useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series
of smaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long
essay for school. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the
chosen topic, organize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough
draft, develop a final draft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the
project. The large task becomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.
