Freudian theory was so popular that it led to a number of followers, including many of Freud’s own
students, who developed, modified, and expanded his theories. Taken together, these approaches are
known as neo-Freudian theories. The neo-Freudian theories are theories based on Freudian principles
that emphasize the role of the unconscious and early experience in shaping personality but place less
evidence on sexuality as the primary motivating force in personality and are more optimistic concerning
the prospects for personality growth and change in personality in adults.
Alfred Adler (1870–1937) was a follower of Freud who developed his own interpretation of Freudian
theory. Adler proposed that the primary motivation in human personality was not sex or aggression,
but rather the striving for superiority. According to Adler, we desire to be better than others and we
accomplish this goal by creating a unique and valuable life. We may attempt to satisfy our need for
superiority through our school or professional accomplishments, or by our enjoyment of music, athletics,
or other activities that seem important to us.
Adler believed that psychological disorders begin in early childhood. He argued that children who are
either overly nurtured or overly neglected by their parents are later likely to develop an inferiority
complex—a psychological state in which people feel that they are not living up to expectations, leading
them to have low self-esteem, with a tendency to try to overcompensate for the negative feelings. People
with an inferiority complex often attempt to demonstrate their superiority to others at all costs, even if
it means humiliating, dominating, or alienating them. According to Adler, most psychological disorders
result from misguided attempts to compensate for the inferiority complex in order meet the goal of
superiority.
Carl Jung (1875–1961) was another student of Freud who developed his own theories about personality.
Jung agreed with Freud about the power of the unconscious but felt that Freud overemphasized the
importance of sexuality. Jung argued that in addition to the personal unconscious, there was also a
collective unconscious, or a collection of shared ancestral memories. Jung believed that the collective
unconscious contains a variety of archetypes, or cross-culturally universal symbols, which explain the
similarities among people in their emotional reactions to many stimuli. Important archetypes include
the mother, the goddess, the hero, and the mandala or circle, which Jung believed symbolized a desire
for wholeness or unity. For Jung, the underlying motivation that guides successful personality is self-
realization, or learning about and developing the self to the fullest possible extent.
Karen Horney (the last syllable of her last name rhymes with “eye”; 1855–1952), was a German
physician who applied Freudian theories to create a personality theory that she thought was more
balanced between men and women. Horney believed that parts of Freudian theory, and particularly the
ideas of the Oedipus complex and penis envy, were biased against women. Horney argued that women’s
sense of inferiority was not due to their lack of a penis but rather to their dependency on men, an
approach that the culture made it difficult for them to break from. For Horney, the underlying motivation
that guides personality development is the desire for security, the ability to develop appropriate and
supportive relationships with others.

Another important neo-Freudian was Erich Fromm (1900–1980). Fromm’s focus was on the negative
impact of technology, arguing that the increases in its use have led people to feel increasingly isolated
from others. Fromm believed that the independence that technology brings us also creates the need
“escape from freedom,” that is, to become closer to others.
