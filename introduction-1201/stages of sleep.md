Although we lose consciousness as we sleep, the brain nevertheless remains active. The patterns of sleep
have been tracked in thousands of research participants who have spent nights sleeping in research labs
while their brain waves were recorded by monitors, such as an electroencephalogram, or EEG (Figure
5.3 “Sleep Labs”).
Sleep researchers have found that sleeping people undergo a fairly consistent pattern of sleep stages,
each lasting about 90 minutes. As you can see in Figure 5.4 “Stages of Sleep”, these stages are of two
major types: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a sleep stage characterized by the presence of quick
fast eye movements and dreaming. REM sleep accounts for about 25% of our total sleep time. During
REM sleep, our awareness of external events is dramatically reduced, and consciousness is dominated
primarily by internally generated images and a lack of overt thinking (Hobson, 2004). During this sleep
stage our muscles shut down, and this is probably a good thing as it protects us from hurting ourselves or
trying to act out the scenes that are playing in our dreams. The second major sleep type, non-rapid eye
movement (non-REM) sleep is a deep sleep, characterized by very slow brain waves, that is further
subdivided into three stages: N1, N2, and N3. Each of the sleep stages has its own distinct pattern of
brain activity (Dement & Kleitman, 1957).
Figure 5.4 Stages of Sleep
During a typical night, our sleep cycles move between REM and non-REM sleep, with each cycle repeating at about
90-minute intervals. The deeper non-REM sleep stages usually occur earlier in the night.
As you can see in Figure 5.5 “EEG Recordings of Brain Patterns During Sleep”, the brain waves that
are recorded by an EEG as we sleep show that the brain’s activity changes during each stage of sleeping.
When we are awake, our brain activity is characterized by the presence of very fast beta waves. When
we first begin to fall asleep, the waves get longer (alpha waves), and as we move into stage N1 sleep,
which is characterized by the experience of drowsiness, the brain begins to produce even slower theta
waves. During stage N1 sleep, some muscle tone is lost, as well as most awareness of the environment.
Some people may experience sudden jerks or twitches and even vivid hallucinations during this initial
stage of sleep.

Each stage of sleep has its own distinct pattern of brain activity.
Normally, if we are allowed to keep sleeping, we will move from stage N1 to stage N2 sleep. During
stage N2, muscular activity is further decreased and conscious awareness of the environment is lost.
This stage typically represents about half of the total sleep time in normal adults. Stage N2 sleep is
characterized by theta waves interspersed with bursts of rapid brain activity known as sleep spindles.
Stage N3, also known as slow wave sleep, is the deepest level of sleep, characterized by an increased
proportion of very slow delta waves. This is the stage in which most sleep abnormalities, such as sleepwalking,
sleeptalking, nightmares, and bed-wetting occur. The sleepwalking murders committed
by Mr. Parks would have occurred in this stage. Some skeletal muscle tone remains, making it possible
for affected individuals to rise from their beds and engage in sometimes very complex behaviors, but
consciousness is distant. Even in the deepest sleep, however, we are still aware of the external world.
If smoke enters the room or if we hear the cry of a baby we are likely to react, even though we are
sound asleep. These occurrences again demonstrate the extent to which we process information outside
consciousness.
After falling initially into a very deep sleep, the brain begins to become more active again, and we
normally move into the first period of REM sleep about 90 minutes after falling asleep. REM sleep is
accompanied by an increase in heart rate, facial twitches, and the repeated rapid eye movements that
give this stage its name. People who are awakened during REM sleep almost always report that they
were dreaming, while those awakened in other stages of sleep report dreams much less often. REM sleep
is also emotional sleep. Activity in the limbic system, including the amygdala, is increased during REM
sleep, and the genitals become aroused, even if the content of the dreams we are having is not sexual.
A typical 25-year-old man may have an erection nearly half of the night, and the common “morning
erection” is left over from the last REM period before waking.
Normally we will go through several cycles of REM and non-REM sleep each night (Figure 5.5 “EEG
Recordings of Brain Patterns During Sleep”). The length of the REM portion of the cycle tends to
increase through the night, from about 5 to 10 minutes early in the night to 15 to 20 minutes shortly
before awakening in the morning. Dreams also tend to become more elaborate and vivid as the night
goes on. Eventually, as the sleep cycle finishes, the brain resumes its faster alpha and beta waves and we
awake, normally refreshed.
