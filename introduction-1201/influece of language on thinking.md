The idea that language and its structures influence and
limit human thought is called linguistic relativity.

The most frequently cited example of this possibility was proposed by Benjamin Whorf (1897–1941),
an American linguist who was particularly interested in Native American languages. Whorf argued
that the Inuit people of Canada (sometimes known as Eskimos) had many words for snow, whereas
English speakers have only one, and that this difference influenced how the different cultures perceived
snow. Whorf argued that the Inuit perceived and categorized snow in finer details than English speakers
possibly could, because the English language constrained perception.
Although the idea of linguistic relativism seemed reasonable, research has suggested that language has
less influence on thinking than might be expected. For one, in terms of perceptions of snow, although it
is true that the Inuit do make more distinctions among types of snow than do English speakers, the latter
also make some distinctions (think “powder,” “slush,” “whiteout,” and so forth). And it is also possible
that thinking about snow may influence language, rather than the other way around.

In a more direct test of the possibility that language influences thinking, Eleanor Rosch (1973) compared
people from the Dani culture of New Guinea, who have only two terms for color (“dark” and “bright”),
with English speakers who use many more terms. Rosch hypothesized that if language constrains
perception and categorization, then the Dani should have a harder time distinguishing colors than would
English speakers. But her research found that when the Dani were asked to categorize colors using new
categories, they did so in almost the same way that English speakers did. Similar results were found
by Frank, Everett, Fedorenko, and Gibson (2008), who showed that the Amazonian tribe known as the
Pirahã, who have no linguistic method for expressing exact quantities (not even the number “one”), were
nevertheless able to perform matches with large numbers without problem

Language may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism. One
recent demonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin
Chinese speakers talk and think about time. English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that
describe changes along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like “I’m running behind
schedule” or “Don’t get ahead of yourself.” While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in
horizontal terms, it is not uncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement. For
example, the past might be described as being “up” and the future as being “down.” It turns out that these
differences in language translate into differences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure
how quickly an individual can recognize temporal relationships. Specifically, when given a series of
tasks with vertical priming, Mandarin Chinese speakers were faster at recognizing temporal relationships
between months.

Although these data led researchers to conclude that the language we use to describe color and number
does not influence our underlying understanding of the underlying sensation, another more recent study
has questioned this assumption. Roberson, Davies, and Davidoff (2000) conducted another study with
Dani participants and found that, at least for some colors, the names that they used to describe colors
did influence their perceptions of the colors. Other researchers continue to test the possibility that our
language influences our perceptions, and perhaps even our thoughts (Levinson, 1998), and yet the
evidence for this possibility is, as of now, mixed.
