One of the most fundamental tendencies of human beings is to size up other people. We say that Bill is
fun, that Marian is adventurous, or that Frank is dishonest. When we make these statements, we mean
that we believe that these people have stable individual characteristics—their personalities. Personality
is defined as an individual’s consistent patterns of feeling, thinking, and behaving (John, Robins, &
        Pervin, 2008).
The tendency to perceive personality is a fundamental part of human nature, and a most adaptive one.
If we can draw accurate generalizations about what other people are normally like, we can predict how
they will behave in the future, and this can help us determine how they are likely to respond in different
situations. Understanding personality can also help us better understand psychological disorders and
the negative behavioral outcomes they may produce. In short, personality matters because it guides
behavior.
