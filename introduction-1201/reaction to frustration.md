Some of the "typical" responses to frustration include anger, quitting (burn out or giving up), loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, stress and [depression](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_depression.htm).

**ANGER**: There is a saying "[[frustration]] begets anger and anger begets aggression." Direct [anger and aggression](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/pyschologist_anger.htm) is expressed toward the object perceived as the cause of the frustration. If a machine does not work, you might hit it or kick it. If someone gets in your way, you could verbally threaten them or push them aside. If the source of the frustration is too powerful or threatening for direct aggression, displaced aggression is often used. The aggression is redirected toward a less threatening and more available object.

An angry person often acts without thinking.  The person has given in to the frustration and they have given up restraint. Anger can be a healthy response if it motivates us to positive action but all too often the actions we engage in when angry are destructive.  Indeed, if we could see a videotape of ourselves getting angry, the humiliation might well help cure us of anger. When you feel frustration building, you have to practice learned responses that lead to healthy actions instead of destructive ones.

**GIVING UP**: Giving up on a goal can be productive if the goal is truly out of reach.  However, more often giving up (quitting or being apathetic) is another form of giving in to frustration. When repeatedly frustrated, people can drop out of school, quit jobs, or move away. Apathy is giving up all of your goals, so you cannot be frustrated by trying to reach them.

We live in difficult time and we have to be persistent in order to accomplish.  Consider how many projects you began, and then gave up, because you became frustrated and lost patience. Make a list of things you started and quit because they seemed too difficult. Now calculate the disappointment and loss you suffered by not dealing with the frustration in a more healthy way.  Try to remember that quitters never win, and winners never quit. Losing your temper means you're a quitter.

**LOSS OF CONFIDENCE**: [Loss of confidence](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_lack_of_confidence.htm) is a terrible frequent side effect of giving up and not fulfilling your goal.  A loss of self-confidence and [self-esteem](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_self_esteem.htm) means that If we quit once, then the next time we plan a goal, we may not be able to accurately assess our ability to carry it out and we stop trusting ourselves and our own abilities.  This became a self-fulfilling and self-destructive attitude. You need to be able to learn that when the going gets tough, you say to yourself  "It is worth it!" and by following through, it not only gets the job done, but it [builds self-confidence](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_lack_of_confidence.htm).

**STRESS**: [Stress](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_stress.htm) is the "wear and tear" our body and mind experiences as we adjust to the frustrations our continually changing environment.  Too frequently, extreme, or prolonged frustration and stress strains us and generates distress signals. Our body experiences distress signals in a variety of ways, often in the form of: irritability, anger, fatigue, [anxiety](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_anxiety.htm), headaches, [depression](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_depression.htm), stomachaches, hypertension, migraines, ulcers, heart attacks, or colitis.

**DEPRESSION**: Depression can affect almost every aspect of your life. It affects people of all ages, income, race, and cultures. Depression can affect the way you eat and [sleep](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/disorders_psychologist_and_psychologists/psychologist_sleep_disorders.htm), the way [you feel about yourself](https://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/emotional_problems_psychologist/psychologist_self_esteem.htm), the way one think about things, and the way you interact with others. While we all feel depression at various appropriate times in our lives, excess or inappropriate depression cannot be easily dismissed or wished away.
