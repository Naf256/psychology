Another method for assessment of personality is projective testing. This kind of test relies on one of
the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud—projection—as a way to assess unconscious processes.
During this type of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is
encouraged to project his feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards—by telling a story, interpreting an
image, or completing a sentence. Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for
example, Exner, 2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of
anxiety, or is likely to become volatile. Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test,
the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS
(Tell-Me-A-Story), and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB). Projective tests are less subject to
intentional distortion; it is hard to fake “good" because it is not obvious what a "good” answer is. Projective
tests are more time consuming for the evaluator than self-report inventories. If an evaluator scores the
Rorschach using the Exner scoring system, the test is considered a valid and reliable measure. However,
the validity of the other projective tests is questionable, and the results are often not usable for court cases
(Goldstein, n.d.).

The Rorschach Inkblot Test was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach
(pronounced “ROAR-shock”). It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client
by a psychologist. Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, “What might this
be?” What the test-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003).
The Rorschach has been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression,
psychosis, and anxiety.

A second projective test is the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), created in the 1930s by Henry Murray,
an American psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan. A person taking the TAT is
shown 8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture (Figure 11.18). The stories
give insight into their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals. The storytelling format
helps to lower a person’s resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004). The TAT
has been used in clinical settings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in
counseling settings to help clients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth.
Standardization of test administration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be
modest to low on validity and reliability (Aronow, Weiss, & Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, & Garb,
2000). Despite these shortcomings, the TAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests.

A third projective test is the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB) developed by Julian Rotter in
1950 (recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter). There are three forms of this
test for use with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form. The tests
include 40 incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible (Figure 11.19).
The average time for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in
length. This test is similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed
that responses will reveal desires, fears, and struggles. The RISB is used in screening college students for
adjustment problems and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, & Sherry, 2010; Rotter & Rafferty 1950)

For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality
assessments. However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore,
2008). It is difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/
cultural groups using personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins

& Jenkins-Moore, 2008). For example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the
result was often shorter story length and low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005). Therefore, it
was vital to develop other personality assessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level
of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). To address this need, Robert Williams developed
the first culturally specific projective test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African
Americans (Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore, 2008). The updated version of the instrument is the
Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB) (Williams, 1972). The C-TCB contains 20 color
images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles. When the C-TCB was compared with the TAT for
African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to increased story length, higher degrees of
positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy, 1997; Hoy-Watkins & Jenkins-Moore,
2008).
The TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test is another tool designed to be culturally relevant
to minority groups, especially Hispanic youths. TEMAS—standing for “Tell Me a Story” but also a play
on the Spanish word temas (themes)—uses images and storytelling cues that relate to minority culture
(Constantino, 1982).
