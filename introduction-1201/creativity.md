#### CREATIVITY
Creativity is the ability to generate, create, or discover new ideas,
solutions, and possibilities. Very creative people often have intense 
knowledge about something, work on it for years, look at novel solutions,
seek out the advice and help of other experts, and take risks. Although 
creativity is often associated with the arts, it is actually a vital form
of  intelligence that  drives people in  many disciplines  to  discover 
something new. Creativity can be found in every area of life, from the way
you decorate your residence to a new way of understanding how a cell works.
==Creativity  is often assessed as a function of one’s ability to engage in 
divergent thinking==. Divergent thinking can be described as thinking “outside
the box;” it allows an individual to arrive at unique, multiple solutions to
a given problem. In contrast, convergent thinking describes the ability to
provide a correct or well-established answer or solution to a problem
