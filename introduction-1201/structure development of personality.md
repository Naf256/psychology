Freud proposed that the mind is divided into three components: id, ego, and superego, and that the
interactions and conflicts among the components create personality (Freud, 1923/1943). According to
Freudian theory, the id is the component of personality that forms the basis of our most primitive
impulses. The id is entirely unconscious, and it drives our most important motivations, including the
sexual drive (libido) and the aggressive or destructive drive (Thanatos). According to Freud, the id is
driven by the pleasure principle—the desire for immediate gratification of our sexual and aggressive
urges. The id is why we smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, view pornography, tell mean jokes about people,
and engage in other fun or harmful behaviors, often at the cost of doing more productive activities.

In stark contrast to the id, the superego represents our sense of morality and oughts. The superego tell
us all the things that we shouldn’t do, or the duties and obligations of society. The superego strives for
perfection, and when we fail to live up to its demands we feel guilty.
In contrast to the id, which is about the pleasure principle, the function of the ego is based on the reality
principle—the idea that we must delay gratification of our basic motivations until the appropriate time
with the appropriate outlet. The ego is the largely conscious controller or decision-maker of personality.
The ego serves as the intermediary between the desires of the id and the constraints of society contained
in the superego (Figure 11.9 “Ego, Id, and Superego in Interaction”). We may wish to scream, yell, or
hit, and yet our ego normally tells us to wait, reflect, and choose a more appropriate response.
