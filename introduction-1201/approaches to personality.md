Early theories assumed that personality was expressed in people’s physical appearance. One early
approach, developed by the German physician Franz Joseph Gall (1758–1828) and known as
phrenology, was based on the idea that we could measure personality by assessing the patterns of bumps
on people’s skulls (Figure 11.1 “Phrenology”). In the Victorian age, phrenology was taken seriously
and many people promoted its use as a source of psychological insight and self-knowledge. Machines
were even developed for helping people analyze skulls (Simpson, 2005). However, because careful
scientific research did not validate the predictions of the theory, phrenology has now been discredited in
contemporary psychology.

Another approach, known as somatology, championed by the psychologist William Herbert Sheldon
(1898–1977), was based on the idea that we could determine personality from people’s body types
(Figure 11.2 “Sheldon’s Body Types”). Sheldon (1940) argued that people with more body fat and a
rounder physique (“endomorphs”) were more likely to be assertive and bold, whereas thinner people
(“ectomorphs”) were more likely to be introverted and intellectual. As with phrenology, scientific
research did not validate the predictions of the theory, and somatology has now been discredited in
contemporary psychology.

Another approach to detecting personality is known as physiognomy, or the idea that it is possible to
assess personality from facial characteristics. In contrast to phrenology and somatology, for which no
research support has been found, contemporary research has found that people are able to detect some
aspects of a person’s character—for instance, whether they are gay or straight and whether they are
Democrats or Republicans—at above chance levels by looking only at his or her face (Rule & Ambady,
2010; Rule, Ambady, Adams, & Macrae, 2008; Rule, Ambady, & Hallett, 2009).
Despite these results, the ability to detect personality from faces is not guaranteed. Olivola and Todorov
(2010) recently studied the ability of thousands of people to guess the personality characteristics of
hundreds of thousands of faces on the website What’s My Image? (http://www.whatsmyimage.com). In
contrast to the predictions of physiognomy, the researchers found that these people would have made
more accurate judgments about the strangers if they had just guessed, using their expectations about
what people in general are like, rather than trying to use the particular facial features of individuals to
help them. It seems then that the predictions of physiognomy may also, in the end, find little empirical
support.
