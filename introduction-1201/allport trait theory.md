Trait theorists believe personality can be understood via the approach that all people have certain traits,
or characteristic ways of behaving. Do you tend to be sociable or shy? Passive or aggressive? Optimistic or
pessimistic? Moody or even-tempered? Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits.
For example, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport & Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English
language that could describe people. He organized these personality traits into three categories: cardinal
traits, central traits, and secondary traits. A cardinal trait is one that dominates your entire personality,
and hence your life—such as Ebenezer Scrooge’s greed and Mother Theresa’s altruism. Cardinal traits are
not very common: Few people have personalities dominated by a single trait. Instead, our personalities
typically are composed of multiple traits. Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as
loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly, sneaky, wild, and grouchy). Secondary traits are those that are not quite
as obvious or as consistent as central traits. They are present under specific circumstances and include
preferences and attitudes. For example, one person gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can
only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet another always orders her salad dressing on the side. And
you—although not normally an anxious person—feel nervous before making a speech in front of your
English class.
