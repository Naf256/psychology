# COMPONENTS OF LANGUAGE
Language, be it spoken, signed, or written, has specific components: a lexicon and grammar. Lexicon refers
to the words of a given language. Thus, lexicon is a language’s vocabulary. Grammar refers to the set
of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). For
instance, English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “-ed” at the end to indicate past tense.
Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language. A phoneme (e.g., the
sounds “ah” vs. “eh”) is a basic sound unit of a given language, and different languages have different
sets of phonemes. Phonemes are combined to form morphemes, which are the smallest units of language
that convey some type of meaning (e.g., “I” is both a phoneme and a morpheme). We use semantics and
syntax to construct language. Semantics and syntax are part of a language’s grammar. Semantics refers to
the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words. Syntax refers to the way words are
organized into sentences (Chomsky, 1965; Fernández & Cairns, 2011).
We apply the rules of grammar to organize the lexicon in novel and creative ways, which allow us to
communicate information about both concrete and abstract concepts. We can talk about our immediate
and observable surroundings as well as the surface of unseen planets. We can share our innermost
thoughts, our plans for the future, and debate the value of a college education. We can provide detailed
instructions for cooking a meal, fixing a car, or building a fire. Through our use of words and language,
we are able to form, organize, and express ideas, schema, and artificial concepts.

## More of phonemes
A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that makes a meaningful difference in a language. The word
“bit” has three phonemes, /b/, /i/, and /t/ (in transcription, phonemes are placed between slashes), and the
word “pit” also has three: /p/, /i/, and /t/. In spoken languages, phonemes are produced by the positions
and movements of the vocal tract, including our lips, teeth, tongue, vocal cords, and throat, whereas in
sign languages phonemes are defined by the shapes and movement of the hands.

There are hundreds of unique phonemes that can be made by human speakers, but most languages only
use a small subset of the possibilities. English contains about 45 phonemes, whereas other languages
have as few as 15 and others more than 60. The Hawaiian language contains only about a dozen
phonemes, including 5 vowels (a, e, i, o, and u) and 7 consonants (h, k, l, m, n, p, and w).
In addition to using a different set of phonemes, because the phoneme is actually a category of sounds
that are treated alike within the language, speakers of different languages are able to hear the difference
only between some phonemes but not others. This is known as the categorical perception of speech
sounds. English speakers can differentiate the /r/ phoneme from the /l/ phoneme, and thus “rake” and
“lake” are heard as different words. In Japanese, however, /r/ and /l/ are the same phoneme, and thus
speakers of that language cannot tell the difference between the word “rake” and the word “lake.” Try
saying the words “cool” and “keep” out loud. Can you hear the difference between the two /k/ sounds?
To English speakers they both sound the same, but to speakers of Arabic these represent two different
phonemes.
Infants are born able to understand all phonemes, but they lose their ability to do so as they get older;
by 10 months of age a child’s ability to recognize phonemes becomes very similar to that of the
adult speakers of the native language. Phonemes that were initially differentiated come to be treated as
equivalent (Werker & Tees, 2002).

Whereas phonemes are the smallest units of sound in language, a morpheme is a string of one or more
phonemes that makes up the smallest units of meaning in a language. Some morphemes, such as one-
letter words like “I” and “a,” are also phonemes, but most morphemes are made up of combinations of
phonemes. Some morphemes are prefixes and suffixes used to modify other words. For example, the
syllable “re-” as in “rewrite” or “repay” means “to do again,” and the suffix “-est” as in “happiest” or
“coolest” means “to the maximum.”

Syntax is the set of rules of a language by which we construct sentences. Each language has a different
syntax. The syntax of the English language requires that each sentence have a noun and a verb, each
of which may be modified by adjectives and adverbs. Some syntaxes make use of the order in which
words appear, while others do not. In English, “The man bites the dog” is different from “The dog bites
the man.” In German, however, only the article endings before the noun matter. “Der Hund beisst den
Mann” means “The dog bites the man” but so does “Den Mann beisst der Hund.A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that makes a meaningful difference in a language. The word

## More on Semantics

Words do not possess fixed meanings but change their interpretation as a function of the context in which
they are spoken. We use contextual information—the information surrounding language—to help us
interpret it. Examples of contextual information include the knowledge that we have and that we know
that other people have, and nonverbal expressions such as facial expressions, postures, gestures, and
tone of voice. Misunderstandings can easily arise if people aren’t attentive to contextual information or
if some of it is missing, such as it may be in newspaper headlines or in text messages.
