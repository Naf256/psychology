# COMPONENTS OF LANGUAGE
Language, be it spoken, signed, or written, has specific components: a lexicon and grammar. Lexicon refers
to the words of a given language. Thus, lexicon is a language’s vocabulary. Grammar refers to the set
of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon (Fernández & Cairns, 2011). For
instance, English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an “-ed” at the end to indicate past tense.
Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language. A phoneme (e.g., the
sounds “ah” vs. “eh”) is a basic sound unit of a given language, and different languages have different
sets of phonemes. Phonemes are combined to form morphemes, which are the smallest units of language
that convey some type of meaning (e.g., “I” is both a phoneme and a morpheme). We use semantics and
syntax to construct language. Semantics and syntax are part of a language’s grammar. Semantics refers to
the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words. Syntax refers to the way words are
organized into sentences (Chomsky, 1965; Fernández & Cairns, 2011).
We apply the rules of grammar to organize the lexicon in novel and creative ways, which allow us to
communicate information about both concrete and abstract concepts. We can talk about our immediate
and observable surroundings as well as the surface of unseen planets. We can share our innermost
thoughts, our plans for the future, and debate the value of a college education. We can provide detailed
instructions for cooking a meal, fixing a car, or building a fire. Through our use of words and language,
we are able to form, organize, and express ideas, schema, and artificial concepts.
