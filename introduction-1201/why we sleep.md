## Adaptive Function of Sleep

One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary
psychology is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have
evolved over time as a result of natural selection. Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior
make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring. One
hypothesis from this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended
during the day. Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at
night to reduce their energy expenditures. While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little
research that supports this explanation. In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that
energetic demands could not be addressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007),
and some research has actually found a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount
of time spent sleeping (Capellini, Barton, McNamara, Preston, & Nunn, 2008).
Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response
to predatory risks, which increase in darkness. Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm.
Again, this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep. Perhaps our ancestors spent
extended periods of time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators. Comparative
research indicates, however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very
complex and equivocal. Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer
hours than other species (Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship
between the amount of time a given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth,
Amlaner, & Lima, 2006).

It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have
evolved different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures. While we have
discussed the negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there
are many benefits that are associated with adequate amounts of sleep. A few such benefits listed by the
National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving
mood, and increasing motor coordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory
formation.

## Cognitive Function of Sleep
Another theory regarding why we sleep involves sleepâ€™s importance for cognitive function and memory
formation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, & Lima, 2007). Indeed, we know sleep deprivation
results in disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our
abilities to maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories. Moreover, these
impairments become more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola & Polo-Kantola,
2007). Furthermore, slow-wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that
task (Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini, & Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation
(Stickgold, 2005). Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand
that cramming all night for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.
