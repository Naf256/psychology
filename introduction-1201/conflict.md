# conflict
the occurrence of mutually antagonistic or opposing forces, including events, behaviors, desires, attitudes, and emotions.

This general term has more specific meanings within different areas of psychology. For example, in psychoanalytic theory, it refers to the opposition between incompatible instinctual impulses or between incompatible aspects of the mental structure (i.e., the id, ego, and superego) that may be a source of neurosis if it results in the use of defense mechanisms other than sublimation.

In interpersonal relations, conflict denotes the disagreement, discord, and friction that occur when the actions or beliefs of one or more individuals are unacceptable to and resisted by others.

#### A conflict is caused under two situations.
**First**, it (conflict) arises when there is an urge to fulfill the two equally important objectives, needs, drives, values, tendencies and impulses.
**Second,**Â conflict arises when two different goals are set to fulfill a single need.

## Types of conflict
conflicts are classified into three types. These are following:

### **An approach-approach conflict:**
An approach-approach conflict is a situation, wherein I the individual is caught between two mutually exclusive goals which are desirable and also are difficult to realize simultaneously. This is exemplified in the following situation. A student prepares for his examination, is keen to secure high marks but at the same time, wishes to attend the wedding of his best friend, both due on the same day.

### **An approach-avoidance conflict:**
approach-avoidance conflict is a situation wherein the individual is motivated to achieve a goal and at the same time develops a tendency to avoid it.
Let us consider a common example. A girl of twenty five wishes to marry a boy who is highly qualified and well placed. She hesitates to achieve her goal because the life style of the boy is totally different from the girl. He smokes and drinks. 

### **An avoidance-avoidance conflict:**
An avoidance-avoidance conflict is a situation, wherein an individual is motivated to avoid both the goals. Observe yet another dilemma. Karan is forced by his friends to see a new movie, which he is reluctant to watch. At the same time, he does not want to displease his friends by saying that he would not accompany them for the movie.
