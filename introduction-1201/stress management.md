## Emotion-focused Coping

==Emotion-focused coping is a type of [[stress]] management that attempts to reduce negative emotional responses associated with stress.== Negative emotions such as embarrassment, fear, anxiety, depression, excitement and [[frustration]] are reduced or removed by the individual by various methods of coping.

==Emotion-focused techniques might be the only realistic option when the source of stress is outside the person’s control.==

Drug therapy can be seen as emotion focused coping as it focuses on the arousal caused by stress not the problem. Other emotion focused coping techniques include:  

-   Distraction, e.g. keeping yourself busy to take your mind off the issue.
    
-   Emotional disclosure. This involves expressing strong emotions by talking or writing about negative events which precipitated those emotions (Pennebaker, 1995) This is an important part of [psychotherapy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychoanalysis.html).
    
-   Praying for guidance and strength.
    
-   Meditation, e.g. mindfulness.
    
-   Eating more, e.g. comfort food.
    
-   Drinking alcohol.
    
-   Using drugs.
    
-   Journaling, e.g. writing a gratitude diary (Cheng, Tsui, & Lam, 2015).
    
-   Cognitive reappraisal. This is a form of cognitive change that involves construing a potentially emotion-eliciting situation in a way that changes its emotional impact (Lazarus & Alfert, 1964).
    
-   Suppressing (stopping/inhibition of) negative thoughts or emotions. Suppressing emotions over an extended period of time compromises immune competence and leads to poor physical health (Petrie, K. J., Booth, R. J., & Pennebaker, 1988).

## Problem-focused Coping

[Problem-focused coping](https://www.simplypsychology.org/solution-focused-therapy.html) targets the causes of stress in practical ways which tackles the problem or stressful situation that is causing stress, consequently directly reducing the stress.

Problem focused strategies aim to remove or reduce the cause of the stressor, including:

-   Problem-solving.
-   Time-management.
-   Obtaining instrumental social support.


A meta-analysis revealed emotion-focused strategies are often less effective than using problem-focused methods in relation to health outcomes(Penley, Tomaka, & Weibe, 2012).

In general problem-focused coping is best, as it removes the stressor, so deals with the root cause of the problem, providing a long term solution.

Problem-focused strategies are successful in dealing with stressors such as discrimination (Pascoe & Richman, 2009), HIV infections (Moskowitz, Hult, Bussolari, & Acree, 2009) and diabettes (Duangdao & Roesch, 2008).

However, it is not always possible to use problem-focused strategies. For example, when someone dies, problem-focused strategies may not be very helpful for the bereaved. Dealing with the feeling of loss requires emotion-focused coping.
