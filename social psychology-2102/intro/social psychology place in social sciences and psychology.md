Social psychology is closely connected to several disciplines within the field
of psy- chology, including personality psychology, clinical psychology, and
cognitive psy- chology.  Personality psychology. Personality psychologists
focus on the role of individual differences, meaning aspects of people’s
personality that make them dif- ferent from other people, in explaining how
different people feel and behave in distinct ways. We often use personality
descriptions to describe other people in our social world—my friend Darren
is extraverted, my co-worker Deirdra is arro- gant, my boss Duane is neurotic.
Whereas personality psychologists emphasize the role of individual differences
between people in influencing attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors, social
psychol- ogists emphasize the role of the situation. For example, if you
observe a person driving very aggressively, you might immediately judge that
person’s personality in a not-very-nice way (“She’s a careless person.”
“She only thinks about herself.”).  A social psychologist, on the other
hand, would try to examine the role of situa- tional factors in producing
that behavior; perhaps the person is late for a job inter- view, or perhaps
that person is taking a sick child to the hospital. When you consider the
situation (the woman was taking her sick child to the hospital), that might
influence your attitude toward the aggressive driver. Do you still judge her
personality as careless or self-centered?  Social psychologists examine how
different people react to different situations in distinct ways. This part of
social psychology focuses specifically on the role of aspects of personality,
such as self-esteem, need for cogni- tion, and prosocial orientation, in
influencing behavior in a given situation. Issues of personality will be
addressed throughout this book. For exam- ple, in Chapter 7 you’ll read
about how different people are persuaded by different types of advertis-
ing messages, and in Chapter 13 you’ll read about how people with high
levels of empathy are more likely to donate money to someone in need.
Clinical psychology. Clinical psy- chology is probably the best-known field
within the larger field of psychology. When people think about the field
of psychology, they often think about the role of clinical psychologists
in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. Clinical psychol- ogy
focuses on understanding and treating people with psychological disorders
such as schizophrenia, depression, and phobias.  Social psychology also
examines issues that are highly relevant for clinical psychol- ogy. Some
social psychologists examine how the presence of very thin female models
in the media can influence women’s attitudes about their own bodies and
thereby contribute to eating disorders (Chapter 3). In Chapter 4 you’ll
learn why people who blame their failures on themselves are at greater
risk of experiencing depression than those who blame their failures on
other people. Other social psychologists examine strategies for promoting
better psychological and physical health, including ways of reducing rates
of smoking (Chapter 6), strategies of increasing condom use (see Chapter 7),
and methods of increasing relationship satisfaction

Cognitive psychology. Cognitive psychology examines mental processes,
including thinking, remembering, learning, and reasoning. For example, a
cog- nitive psychologist might examine why people are more likely to buy a
$200 sweater that is on sale for $50 than a sweater that is simply priced
at $50, why some people have higher IQs than others, and why we sometimes
“remember” things as having happened when they really didn’t happen.
The social cognitive perspective is a combination of social psychology
and cogni- tive psychology. This perspective refers to how people think
about themselves and the social world, with a particular focus on how they
make judgments and decisions about the world. In some cases our thoughts
can lead us to make good and accurate decisions. In other cases, however,
our thinking can lead us astray. For example, which of the following poses
the greatest threat to children’s safety: kidnapping by strangers or car
accidents? Although many parents worry most about the first event, many,
many more children are killed in motor vehicle accidents each year (often
because they are not wearing a seatbelt or riding in a car seat) than are
killed by a kidnap- per. We’ll learn more about this and other errors in
thinking in Chapter 5.

Social psychology is a distinct field within psychology, but it shares a
number of features with other fields within psychology as well as with other
disciplines. This section will examine the links between social psychology
and sociology, biology, anthropology, and economics.

Sociology. Sociology examines general rules and theories about groups, rang-
ing from very small groups to large societies, and specifically how such
groups affect people’s attitudes and behavior. Sociologists are likely
to focus on broad group-level variables such as culture, social class, and
ethnicity. For example, a sociologist might examine why rates of homicide
in the United States are much higher than in other countries.  Similarly,
social psychologists study how individual people behave in groups, as well
as how one’s group or culture can influence a person’s behavior. In
Chapter 11 you’ll learn why homicide rates are higher in some subcultures
within the United States than in others. However, social psychologists are
more likely to focus on the effects of immediate and specific variables,
such as mood, temperature, and other people, on attitudes and behaviors,
and to examine the influence of the group on the individual, not simply the
effect of the group in general.

Biology. The field of biology exam- ines the structure, function, growth,
ori- gin, and evolution of living things.  Biologists examine how species
evolve over time, the role of genes in influencing traits and attributes,
and how individuals grow and develop over time. A biologist might examine
how a parent’s level of aggression influences his or her child’s level
of aggression, and why men and women look for different characteristics in
sexual partners.

The link between social psychology and biology has received increasing atten-
tion in recent years as research in social psychology has examined the
role of biol- ogy in influencing such factors as aggression, altruism, and
attraction. The subfield of evolutionary psychology examines how biological
factors can influence people’s behavior; it proposes that certain types
of behaviors are “selected for” and hence have survived over time. In
Chapter 11, you’ll learn how evolutionary pressures influence rates of
aggression, and why men tend to show higher levels of aggres- sion than
women. In Chapter 12 you’ll read about how evolutionary psycholo- gists
explain gender differences in preferences for different characteristics in
a dating partner as well as why men and women may find that different types
of infidelity trigger their jealousy. Chapter 13 examines the influence of
evolution- ary pressures on whom people help—and why, in an emergency,
we favor young people over older ones, and genetically close relatives
(siblings, children, parents) over more distantly related ones (cousins,
aunts and uncles, grandparents).

Anthropology. Anthropology examines the concept of culture, and specifi- cally
the role of culture in influencing people’s attitudes and behavior. For
exam- ple, anthropologists study the social significance of food in different
cultures, the impact of culture on gender differences, and how cultures
vary in their interpre- tations of the links between health and illness.
Social psychology originated in Western cultures, and hence much of the early
work in this area was conducted by Western researchers using people living in
Western cul- tures. However, in the last two decades social psychologists
have shown increasing interest in examining the impact of culture on
people’s thoughts, feelings, and behav- iors. The impact of culture on
theory and research in social psychology will be described in detail in
the final section of each chapter. For example, you’ll learn about the
impact of culture on rates of aggression (Chapter 11), definitions of love
(Chapter 12), and frequency of helping behavior (Chapter 13).

Economics. Economics studies how people make trade-offs between scarce
resources and how they choose between various alternatives. For example,
an econ- omist might examine how people choose between two different jobs,
or the fac- tors that lead a person to spend money now versus save it for the
future. Economists also examine why people make choices that do not maximize
their well-being— such as giving money to charitable causes instead of using
it themselves—and why people make cognitive errors. For example, a person
may choose one medical treat- ment when it’s presented as the numbers of
years of life to be gained but turn down that medical treatment if it’s
presented in terms of years lost.  In particular, the field of behavioral
economics applies research on social, cog- nitive, and emotional biases to
understand how people make economic decisions (Ariely & Norton, 2007; Thaler,
1980). In 2002, Professor Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University received
the Nobel Prize in Economics (although his field is psychology) in large part
due to his focus on issues at the intersection of psychol- ogy and economics,
including fairness in the marketplace (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler, 1986a,
1986b, 1990). In Chapter 5 you’ll learn about Kahneman’s research on
errors in social decision making.  Social psychologists also focus on how
people make particular choices as well as the costs and benefits of various
alternatives. In Chapter 9, you’ll learn how people make decisions that
will benefit themselves versus benefit their broader group. In Chapter 12,
you’ll learn that physically attractive people experience many benefits
that others do not, including higher starting salaries and bigger raises. In
Chapter 13 you’ll learn about the cost-benefit analysis people perform
before they decide to help a person in need.
