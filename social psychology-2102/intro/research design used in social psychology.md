What are the effects on children of watching violence on television? This is a
question of great importance to parents, and this question can be answered by
research in social psychology. In a classic study, researchers were interested
in examining the power of modeling on aggressive behavior (Bandura, Ross,
& Ross, 1963). Children were shown a video of an adult throwing around,
punch- ing, and kicking an inflatable Bobo doll. The video was very unusual
and spe- cific in terms of the behavior and words modeled (e.g., the adult
sat on the doll, punched it in the nose, hit him with a wooden mallet, and
said “Sock him in the nose” and “Hit him down”). The researcher then
observed the children’s behavior following a frustrating event—such as
being shown some very attrac- tive toys but then being told that these toys
were being saved for another child, and given some less desirable toys to
play with. As expected, children who’d watched the adult aggress against
the Bobo doll replicated much of that behav- ior, even using the same words
and actions. This study provides powerful evi- dence that children model
what they see on television (and you’ll read more about this in Chapter 6).

This study, and other studies within the field of social psychology, was
designed using the scientific method. This section will describe each of
the steps involved in the research process (see Figure 2.1):

• Step 1: Form a question • Step 2: Search the literature • Step 3:
Form a hypothesis • Step 4: Create an operational definition • Step 5:
Collect and analyze data • Step 6: Propose and/or revise a theory

FORM A QUESTION All research in social psychology as well as in other
scientific fields starts with a question. Many studies in social psychology
start with a question based on observation of a real-world event. In Chapter
13 you’ll learn about the murder of Kitty Genovese, which occurred while
other peo- ple were watching, yet failed to call the police. Why didn’t
anyone call for help? This tragic event led to numerous studies on the factors
that predict helping (or, in this case, not helping). Sometimes people form
these questions based on their own experiences or observations. For example,
you might observe that you feel fat after watching Dancing With the Stars or
that you run faster when you are run- ning with friends than alone. In other
cases, these questions are formed based on intuition, or a “gut feeling.”


Sometimes these questions are designed to test established theories in psychol-
ogy. For example, researchers who examined the predictors of prejudice and dis-
crimination initially believed that conflict between people in different groups
led to such behaviors—a theory known as Realistic Conflict Theory. You’ll
learn more about this theory in Chapter 10.


### SEARCH THE LITERATURE Because some ideas that you have are likely to have
been studied by others, it is a good idea to start investigating these ideas
by figuring out what other people might have found about the same, or similar,
ideas. Go to the library and read journal arti- cles about research, or search
for topics on the Web. Use online databases, such as PsychINFO and PsychLIT,
that let you search for articles by a particular topic or author. Check out
the library homepage at your school or ask a librarian for access.


### FORM A HYPOTHESIS A hypothesis is a testable prediction about the
conditions under which an event will occur. It is a statement about the
expected cause and effect relationship between two variables, but has greater
specificity than the original question you asked. Because a hypothesis could
be directly tested, it includes a specific predic- tion. For example, you
could have a hypothesis that children who watch a lot of television will
engage in more aggressive behavior against their peers during recess than
those who watch less television


### CREATE AN OPERATIONAL DEFINITION An operational definition describes a
specific procedure or measure of how you will test this hypothesis. If you
want to test whether absence makes the heart grow fonder, you need to decide
how you will classify fonder (Is it what people report on a survey? Is it how
often they touch and kiss when they are together?), and how you will classify
absence (a weekend? a month?). Researchers can define their variables in
very different ways, which in turn can influence the findings.


### COLLECT AND ANALYZE DATA Data can be collected in a number of different
ways—by observation, surveys, or experiments. To test whether heterosexual
women eat less when they are with male dating partners, you could go to
restaurants and see what women eat when they are with other women versus
men. Or you could ask women what they eat when they are with a date versus
when they are with a friend, or design a “food tasting” study to see
whether women in same-sex pairs eat more than those in opposite-sex pairs.
Media Connections describes a new approach to collecting data on the Internet.
After the data are collected, the next step is to analyze the data. For many
researchers, this is the best part of conducting research because they get
to see if their ideas are supported by data.
