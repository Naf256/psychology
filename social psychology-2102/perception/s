Kelly's theory in person perception is known as the Covariation Model, also referred to as the Attribution Theory or the Attributional Calculus. Developed by Harold Kelley, this theory focuses on how people make attributions or judgments about the causes of others' behavior. The theory proposes that individuals make causal attributions by considering three types of covariation information: consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency.

1. Consensus: Consensus refers to the extent to which other people behave similarly in a given situation. If multiple individuals exhibit the same behavior in a particular context, high consensus is perceived. Low consensus indicates that the behavior is unique to the individual. For example, if several people laugh at a joke, high consensus is inferred, suggesting that the joke is funny.

2. Distinctiveness: Distinctiveness refers to the extent to which an individual behaves similarly across different situations. High distinctiveness indicates that the behavior is specific to a particular situation, while low distinctiveness suggests that the behavior is consistent across various contexts. For example, if a person only laughs at one person's jokes but remains serious with others, high distinctiveness is perceived.

3. Consistency: Consistency refers to the extent to which an individual behaves similarly in a given situation across time. High consistency suggests that the behavior is stable and predictable, while low consistency indicates that the behavior is variable. For example, if a person consistently laughs at jokes over time, high consistency is inferred.

According to Kelley's theory, people integrate information about consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency to make attributions about the causes of behavior. The theory proposes the following attributional principles:

1. Consensus Principle: When consensus is high (others behave similarly), people are more likely to attribute behavior to external or situational factors rather than internal causes. They assume that the behavior is a response to the situation.

2. Distinctiveness Principle: When distinctiveness is high (behavior is specific to a situation), people are more likely to attribute behavior to external or situational factors rather than internal causes. They assume that the behavior is a result of the unique circumstances.

3. Consistency Principle: When consistency is high (behavior is consistent over time), people are more likely to attribute behavior to internal or dispositional factors. They assume that the behavior reflects the person's stable traits or characteristics.

By considering these covariation principles, individuals make attributions about the causes of others' behavior. The Covariation Model provides a systematic framework for understanding how people perceive and explain the behavior of others. It emphasizes the importance of considering multiple sources of information to make accurate attributions.
