Perceptual response in social psychology is influenced by various basic
processes that shape how individuals interpret and respond to social
stimuli. These processes include selective attention, attribution, impression
formation, and schema activation. Let's explore each of these processes:

1. Selective Attention: Selective attention refers to the tendency to focus
on certain aspects of the environment while ignoring others. Individuals have
limited cognitive resources, so they unconsciously filter and prioritize
information that is most relevant or meaningful to them. This filtering
process affects how people perceive and interpret social stimuli. For example,
if someone has a positive bias, they may selectively attend to positive
information about others and overlook negative information.

2. Attribution: Attribution involves the process of assigning causes to
behavior or events. When people observe others' behavior, they often try
to explain why they acted the way they did. Attribution can be internal
(based on the person's characteristics or traits) or external (attributed to
situational factors). Different attributions can lead to different perceptions
and judgments of individuals or groups. For instance, if someone believes
that a person's success is due to their personal ability rather than luck,
they may perceive that person more positively.

3. Impression Formation: Impression formation is the process of creating mental
representations or impressions of other people based on initial observations
or limited information. When meeting someone for the first time, individuals
rely on various cues, such as physical appearance, nonverbal behavior,
and verbal communication, to form initial impressions. These impressions
can significantly influence subsequent interactions and perceptions of that
individual. For example, if someone perceives another person as warm and
friendly upon first meeting, they may be more likely to view them positively
in future interactions.

4. Schema Activation: Schemas are mental frameworks or structures that organize
knowledge and expectations about specific concepts or social categories. They
guide information processing by providing a basis for interpretation and
memory recall. When encountering a stimulus, relevant schemas are activated,
influencing how individuals perceive and interpret the situation. Schemas
can be based on stereotypes or general knowledge about a particular group
or concept. They can shape perception by highlighting certain aspects and
suppressing others, leading to biases in judgment. For example, if someone
holds a stereotype that older people are forgetful, they may selectively
attend to and remember instances that confirm this belief.

These basic processes work together to shape individuals' perceptual responses
in social situations. By understanding these processes, social psychologists
can study and explain how people form impressions, make judgments, and
interpret the social world around them.
