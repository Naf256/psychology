Characteristics of person perception:

1. Subjectivity: Person perception is subjective, as it involves the
interpretation and evaluation of others based on individual perspectives,
experiences, and biases. Different individuals may perceive and evaluate the
same person differently based on their own cognitive processes and personal
characteristics.

2. Perceptual Organization: Person perception involves organizing and
integrating various cues and information about individuals to form a coherent
and meaningful impression. People tend to rely on cognitive schemas, mental
frameworks, or stereotypes to facilitate the organization and processing of
information in person perception.

3. Inference and Attribution: Person perception involves making inferences and
attributions about others' characteristics, traits, and intentions. People
use available information and cues to draw conclusions and make judgments
about someone's personality, motives, and internal states. Attributional
processes, such as attributing behavior to dispositional or situational
factors, are integral to person perception.

4. Context Dependence: Person perception is influenced by the social context
in which it occurs. The same person may be perceived differently depending
on the situation or the role they are in. Contextual factors, such as the
presence of others, the physical environment, and social norms, can shape
person perception and lead to variations in judgments and impressions.

5. Perceptual Bias: Person perception is prone to various cognitive biases
and heuristics that can distort or influence judgments. These biases include
confirmation bias, halo effect, stereotyping, and the primacy and recency
effects. These biases can impact the accuracy and objectivity of person
perception.

Understanding the factors related to person perception and the characteristics
of person perception is crucial in social psychology. It helps explain how
individuals form impressions, make judgments, and attribute characteristics
to others. By studying person perception, researchers aim to uncover the
underlying processes and biases, improve accuracy in social judgments,
and understand the dynamics of social interactions.
