# Thurston Scale

The Thurstone scale is a psychometric scaling technique used to measure
attitudes or opinions. It was developed by psychologist Louis Leon Thurstone in
the 1920s.

The Thurstone scale works by presenting participants with a series of statements
related to the attitude being measured. These statements are selected based on
their relevance and representativeness of the attitude being measured.

Next, a group of judges or experts is asked to sort the statements into
categories based on their degree of positivity or negativity. For example, they
may sort the statements into categories ranging from "strongly agree" to
"strongly disagree".

Participants are then asked to rate each statement on a numerical scale,
typically ranging from 1 to 11, indicating how strongly they agree or disagree
with the statement. The ratings are then used to calculate an overall score for
each participant.

The key feature of the Thurstone scale is that the statements are carefully
selected to represent a range of attitudes or positions, with an equal number of
positive and negative statements. This allows for a more nuanced and accurate
measurement of attitudes than a simple agree-disagree scale.

For example, if the attitude being measured is towards a particular political
candidate, the statements might include positive statements such as "I believe
the candidate has strong leadership skills" and negative statements such as "I
disagree with the candidate's stance on healthcare reform."

To calculate an individual's score on the Thurstone scale, the scores of the statements that they agree with are summed and then divided by the total number of statements they agreed with. This yields an average score that represents their overall attitude or opinion towards the object being measured.

Overall, the Thurstone scale is a useful tool for researchers looking to measure
attitudes or opinions in a more nuanced and detailed way.

However, it can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to develop and
administer, and the accuracy of the scores depends on the quality of the
statements and the judgment of the sorting experts.
