What is Associationism?
the
Associationism is a theory that connects learning to thought based on principles of
organism's causal history. It views that mental processes can be explained in terms of the
association of ideas. It has claimed that pairs of thoughts become associated based on the
organisms past experience. It means that ideas originated in experience. entering the mind
through the senses and undergoing certain associative operations.
Associationism's popularity is in part due to how many different masters it can serve. In
particular, associationism can be used as:
a. A theory of learning
b. A theory of thinking
c. A theory of mental structures
d. A theory of the implementation of thought
All these theories are separable, but share a related, empiricist-friendly core. As used
here, a "pure associationist" will refer to one who holds associationist theories of learning.
thinking, mental structure, and implementation.
Although the original idea of associationism can be found in Plato, it is Aristotle who
gets the credit for elaborating on it. According to Aristotle, association took place in the
"common sense." It was in the common sense that the look, the feel, the smell, the taste of an
apple, for example, came together to become the idea of an apple.
Aristotle counted four laws of association when he examined the processes of
remembrance and recall:
a. The law of contiguity. Things or events that occur close to each other in space or time
tend to get linked together in the mind. If you think of a cup, you may think of a saucer:
if you think of making coffee, you may then think of drinking that coffee.

b. The law of frequency. The more often two things or events are linked.
powerful will be that association. If you have an Ã©clair with your coffee every day and
and you
have done so for the last twenty years, the association will be strong indeed
will be fat.
c. The law of similarity. If two things are similar, the thought of one will tend to trigger
the thought of the other.
d. The law of contrast. Secing or recalling something may trigger the recollection of
something completely opposite. If you think of the tallest person you know, you may
suddenly recall the shortest one as well.
For 2000 years, these four laws were assumed to hold true. No one, however, cared that much
about association. It was seen as just a simple description of a common place occurrence.
During the enlightenment, philosophers began to become interested in the idea again, as a part of
their studies of vision as well as their interest in epistemology.
Hobbes understood complex experiences as being associations of simple experiences.
which in turn were associations of sensations. The basic means of association, according to
Hobbes, was coherence (contiguity), and the basic strength factor was repetition (frequency).
The philosopher John Lacke (1632-1704) introduced the term "association of ideas" in
the fourth edition of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1700), where he described it
as detrimental to rational thought. He suggested that complex emotions derived from pain and
pleasure (simple ideas) associated with other ideas.
The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) proposed the principles of similarity
and contiguity, asserting that ideas that are similar or experienced simultaneously (or in rapid
succession) become associated with each other. He lists three natural laws of association: the law
of resemblance, the law of contiguity, the law of cause and effect.
George Berkeley (1685-1753), an Irish bishop, applied association principles to visual
depth perception, arguing that the capacity to see things in three dimensions is the result of
learning, not of innate ability.
The British physician David Hartley (1705-1757) was responsible for making the idea of
associationism popular, especially in a book called Observations of Man. He dealt with the
biological implications of associationism, formulating a neuro-physiological theory about the
transmission of ideas and also describing physical activity in terms of association. His emphasis

was on the law of contiguity (in time and space) and the law of frequency. But he added an idea
he got from the famous Isaac Newton: the association was a matter of tuned "vibrations" within
the nerves! Hartley also developed a comprehensive theory of associationism that encompassed
memory, imagination, dreams, and morality.
James Mill (1773-1836) also elaborated on Hume's associationism. The elder Mill
proposed a mechanistic theory that linked ideas together in "compounds" through the law of
contiguity, with the law of frequency. His emphasis on the law of frequency as the key to
earning makes his approach very similar to the behaviorists in the twentieth century. He decided
to use the principles of utilitarianism and associationism to educate his son John Stuart Mill
"scientifically." The younger Mill, whose defining metaphor for the association of ideas was
"mental chemistry." differed from his father in claiming that the mind played an active rather
than a passive role in forming associations.
Other 19th-century figures known for associationist ideas were Thomas Browne, who
proposed several secondary laws of association (e.g., duration, liveliness, frequency etc.) and
Alexander Bain (1818-1903), who formulated a comprehensive psychological system based on
association. He connected associationism with physiology.
Hermann Ebbinghaus was the first psychologist who made an effort to study
association scientifically.
Criticism of Associationism:
1. Associationism regards mental causation as combination, composition, or association.
But association and reproduction are not only form of psychical causation.
2. Associationism wrongly denies the unity and activity of the mind.
3. Associationism wrongly regards perception as an aggregate of sensations and memory
images. Gestalt psychology rightly regards perception as an experience of a whole, a
gestalt or a configuration, which cannot be broken up into elementary units.
4. Associationism wrongly regards voluntary actions as mechanical aggregates of reflex
actions. Voluntary actions are unitary acts deliberation and choice on the part of the
subject or self. They involve the subject's evaluation of a situation and reaction to it.
5. Associationism has been rejected by contemporary schools of psychology.
