## Socrates, the philosopher

One of the greatest Greek philosophers (in fact the philosophers before him are sometimes referred to as pre-Socratics), Socrates **was born in Athens during 470 BC.**, from a midwife mother and a sculptor father. Although the details of his life are doubtful, the different writings indicate that this humble family man had great ingenuity since childhood, training in different disciplines such as literature and music.His participation in different wars as an infantryman is known, such as that of the Peloponnese, and that he married a woman named Xantipa.

The progressive advance of science and its search for objectivity can make it difficult for many to observe the relationship between the current state of matter, in this case psychology and philosophy. However, the contributions of Socrates both to this and to other sciences is of great value and importance. Here are some of these contributions.

## 1. Interest in the psyche

Socrates and his disciple Plato worked and reflected on the existence of the psyche, **what they considered the soul**. The influence of this fact on the current science of psychology is evident, its birth being the product of reflection on the contents of our mind derived from these and other authors.

## 2. Ethics and morals

Socrates focused his thinking on ethics and morals. The behavior of the individual in society and the formation of patterns of behavior, attitudes and values are some of the many aspects with which psychology deals.

## 3. Inductive method

Socrates is considered one of the forerunners when it comes to the creation of the inductive method, by claiming that people **have access to the knowledge of the truth through their experience** instead of starting from supposed and considered good knowledge. This method is of great importance in turn when generating the scientific method, characterized by hypothetical-deductive reasoning.

## 4. Socratic method

**Socratic dialogue** It is a strategy based on Socrates' maieutics that continues to be used even today in the practice of psychology, being basic in multiple therapies. It is based on asking inductive questions: the therapist asks different questions in order to make the subject reflect and find their own answer to what was raised.

## 5. Precursor of constructivism

Constructivism is based on the creation of knowledge by generating shared knowledge that in turn depends on the subject being able to make sense of the material learned. Socrates considered that **not what to think, but how to do it should be taught**. This consideration is linked to the search for constructivism for the student to generate their own learning process, thanks to the application of various aids offered by the medium. Thus, as Socrates proposed, the teacher must help the student to generate to create their own knowledge.

## 6. Use of irony: Confrontation

Socrates was characterized by making use of, **in his dialectical method, of irony**. It was intended to make the subject see that the contradictions in his speech were considered wise and to refute his biased arguments in order to make him aware of his true level of knowledge.

**In therapy it is sometimes used** **a similar strategy****, the confrontation**, in which the subject is exposed to the contradictions in his speech or between his speech and his behavior in order to make him aware of them.
