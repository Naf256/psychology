### Aristotle (384–322 B.C.E.)
If we define psychology as a formal study of the mind and a more systematic
approach to understanding and curing mental conditions, then the Ancient
Greeks were certainly leading protagonists. Aristotle was at the vanguard of
developing the foundations of the history of psychology according to the 
scientific researches. Aristotle’s psychology, as would be expected, was 
knotted with his philosophy of the mind, reasoning, but the psychological 
method started with his dazzling mind and pragmatic approach.

Aristotle is a lofty character in ancient Greek philosophy, making assistance
to logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics,
agriculture, medicine, dance and theater. He was a student of Plato who in turn
studied under Socrates. He was more empirically-minded than Plato or Socrates 
and is famous for rebuffing Plato’s theory of forms

Of course, it would be unfair to distillate fully on Aristotle’s psychology 
without studying some of the other great thinkers who subsidized to the history
of psychology, but his work unquestionably is the basis of contemporary methods.
Any modern psychologist of note fully understands the basics of Aristotelian 
thought and make out his contribution to the history of psychology. To give
Aristotle (384 BC — 322 BC) thorough recognition for being the first thinker to
develop a theory of proto-psychology is prejudicial to some of the other 
philosophers from Greece and beyond. However, whilst there is little doubt that
the Babylonians and Buddhists, amongst others, developed concepts involving the 
mind, thought and reasoning, much of their tradition was passed on orally and is
lost. For this reason, the Ancient Greeks provide a useful starting point as we 
delve into the history of psychology.

Aristotle, building upon the work of the earlier philosophers and their studies 
into mind, reasoning and thought, wrote the first known text in the history of
psychology, called Para Psyche, ‘About the Mind.’ In this landmark work, he laid
out the first tenets of the study of reasoning that would determine the direction 
of the history of psychology; many of his proposals continue to influence modern 
psychologists.

In Para Psyche, Aristotle’s psychology proposed that the mind was the ‘first entelechy,’
or primary reason for the existence and functioning of the body. This line of 
thought was heavily influenced by Aristotle’s zoology, where he proposed that 
there were three types of souls defining life; the plant soul, the animal soul 
and the human soul, which gave humanity the unique ability to reason and create.
Interestingly, this human soul was the ultimate link with the divine and Aristotle
believed that mind and reason could exist independently of the body.

Aristotle famously rejected Plato’s theory of forms, which states that properties 
such as beauty are abstract universal entities that exist independent of the objects
themselves. Instead, he argued that forms are intrinsic to the objects and cannot 
exist apart from them, and so must be studied in relation to them. Aristotle was the
founder of the lyceum, a school of learning based in Athens, Greece; and he was an
inspiration for the peripatetics, his followers from the Lyceum.

Aristotle is often regarded as the father of psychology, and his book, De Anima 
(On the Soul), the first book on psychology. He was concerned with the connection 
between the psychological processes and the underlying physiological phenomenon. 
Many believe he contributed more to prescience psychology than any other person,
both qualitatively and quantitatively. Although Aristotle attended Plato’s Academy, 
he became convinced of the need for empirical observations and criticized many of 
Plato’s philosophies. Aristotle believed that thinking requires the use of images.
While some animals can imagine, only man thinks. Knowing (nous) differs from thinking
in that it is an active, creative process leading to the recognition of universals; 
it is akin to intuition, it does not cause movement, and it is independent of the 
other functions of the psyche.
