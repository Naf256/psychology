Theoretical Probability:

Theoretical probability, also known as classical or a priori probability,
is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring based on mathematical
principles and the assumption of equally likely outcomes in a well-defined
sample space.  Empirical Probability:

Empirical probability, also known as relative frequency probability, is
a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring based on observed data
or the results of experiments. It is calculated by dividing the number
of favorable outcomes by the total number of trials or observations.
Subjective Probability:

Subjective probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event
occurring based on an individual's personal beliefs, judgment, and
intuition. It is highly subjective and varies from person to person
based on their subjective assessment of the probability.
