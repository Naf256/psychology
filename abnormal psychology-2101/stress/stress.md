To understand the role of stress, we must first be able to define and measure it. Neither task
is simple, Stress has been defined in many ways. Perhaps one
of the more influential antecedents to our current conceptualizations of stress was the work
by the physician Hans Selye. He introduced the term general adaptation syn-
drome (GAS) to describe the biological response to sustained and high lev-
els of stress. In Selye’s model there are three phases of the response - 

1. During the first phase, the alarm reaction, the autonomic nervous system
is activated by the stress.
2. During the second phase, resistance, the organism tries to adapt to the
stress through available coping mechanisms.
3. If the stressor persists or the organism is unable to adapt effectively, the
third phase, exhaustion, follows, and the organism dies or suffers irreversible
damage (Selye, 1950).

In Selye’s syndrome, the emphasis was on the body’s response, not the environmental events
that trigger that response. Psychological researchers later broadened Selye’s concept to account
for the diverse stress responses that people exhibited, including emotional upset, deterioration
of performance, or physiological changes such as increases in the levels of certain hormones.
The problem with these response-focused definitions of stress is that the criteria are not clear-
cut. Physiological changes in the body can occur in response to a number of things that we
would not consider stressful (e.g., anticipating a pleasurable event).
Other researchers defined stress as a stimulus, often referred to as a stressor, rather than a
response, and identified stress with a long list of environmental conditions, such as electric
shock, boredom, catastrophic life events, daily hassles, and sleep deprivation. Stimuli that are
considered stressors can be major (the death of a loved one), minor (daily hassles, such as being
stuck in traffic), acute (failing an exam), or chronic (a persistently unpleasant work environ-
ment). For the most part, they are experiences that people regard as unpleasant, but they can
also be pleasant events.

Like response-based definitions of stress, stimulus-based definitions present problems. It
is important to acknowledge, that people vary widely in how they respond to life’s challenges.
A given event does not elicit the same amount of stress in everyone. For example, a family that
has lost its home in a flood but has money enough to rebuild and strong social support from a
network of friends nearby will experience less stress from this event than will a family that has
neither adequate money to rebuild nor a network of friends to provide social support.
As a way of addressing the limitations associated with defining stress as either a response
or a stimulus, researchers have emphasized that how we perceive or appraise the environment
determines whether a stressor is present. Stress is perhaps most completely conceptualized as
the subjective experience of distress in response to perceived envi-
ronmental problems. A final exam that is merely challenging to
some students may be highly stressful to others who do not feel prepared to take it (whether
their concerns are realistic or not).
