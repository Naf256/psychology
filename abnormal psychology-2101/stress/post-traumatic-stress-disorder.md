Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) entails an extreme response to a severe
stressor, including increased anxiety, avoidance of stimuli asso- ciated with
the trauma, and a general numbing of emotional responses.  Although people have
known for many years that the stresses of com- bat can have powerful adverse
effects on soldiers, the aftermath of the Vietnam War spurred the development
of this diagnosis.  Like other disorders in the DSM-IV-TR, PTSD is defined
by a clus- ter of symptoms, but unlike other disorders, one criterion for
diag- nosis is exposure to a specific type of situation—a traumatic event.
The person must have experienced or witnessed an event that involved actual
or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity
of the self or others. The trauma must have created intense fear, horror,
or a sense of helplessness. As noted above, war veterans have often been
exposed to these sorts of severe trau- mas. For women, rape is the most common
type of trauma preceding PTSD (Creamer, Burgess, & McFarlane, 2001), with at
least one-third of women meeting criteria for PTSD after a rape (cf. Breslau
et al., 1999).  The symptoms for PTSD are grouped into three major categories:

● Reexperiencing the traumatic event. The person often recalls the event
or has nightmares about it. The person may be intensely upset by reminders of
the event (e.g., helicopter sounds that remind a veteran of the battlefield;
darkness that reminds a woman of a rape).

● Avoidance of stimuli associated with the event or a general numbing
of responsiveness.  Some may try to avoid all reminders of the event. For
example, a Turkish earthquake survivor stopped sleeping indoors after
he was buried alive at night (McNally, 2003).  Other people try to avoid
thinking about the trauma; some may remember only disor- ganized fragments
of the event. Numbing refers to a decreased interest in others, a sense of
estrangement from others, and an inability to feel positive emotions. These
symptoms may seem contradictory to reexperiencing symptoms; generally,
the person goes back and forth between reexperiencing and numbing.

● Symptoms of increased arousal. These symptoms include difficulty
falling asleep or staying asleep, irritability, difficulty concentrating,
hypervigilance, and an exaggerated startle response.  Laboratory studies have
confirmed these clinical symptoms by documenting the heightened physiological
responses of people with PTSD to images of combat (Orr et al., 2003).
