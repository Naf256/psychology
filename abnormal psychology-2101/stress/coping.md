# Coping and Health

Relevant to individual differences in perceptions of potentially stressful situations is the con-
cept of coping, or how people try to deal with problems, including the problem of handling
the typically negative emotions stress produces. Even among those who perceive a situation
as stressful, the effects of the stress may vary depending on how the person copes with it.
Researchers have identified two broad dimensions of coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984):

- Problem-focused coping involves taking direct action to solve the problem or seeking informa-
tion that will be relevant to the solution. An example would be developing a study schedule
covering an entire semester in order to reduce end-of-semester pressure.

- Emotion-focused coping involves efforts to reduce the negative emotional reactions to stress—for
example, by distracting oneself from the problem, relaxing, or seeking comfort from others.

Problem-focused and emotion-focused coping are more effective depending upon the sit-
uation. For example, distraction may be an effective way of dealing with the emotional upset
produced by impending surgery, for example, but it would be a poor way to handle the upset
produced by the discovery of a lump on the breast (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). Similarly, per-
sistently trying to solve a problem that is unsolvable leads to increases in frustration, rather than
providing any psychological benefit (Terry & Hynes, 1998).

Coping researchers also refer to avoidance coping, which involves aspects of both problem-
focused and emotion-focused coping (Carver & Scheier, 1999). The essence of avoidance cop-
ing is either attempting to avoid admitting that there is a problem to deal with (e.g., by denial)
or neglecting to do anything about the problem (e.g., by giving up or just wishing the problem
would go away). In some cases, avoidance coping (e.g., giving up) may be a practical approach—
for example, a person who has repeatedly been denied admission to graduate school may do
best by giving up on this endeavor and instead focusing on pursuing a different career path. In
general, however, evidence indicates that avoidance coping is the least effective method of deal-
ing with most problems (Roesch & Weiner, 2001).
The role of positive emotions in coping is an area of current interest to researchers
(Folkman & Moskowitz, 2000). Positive emotions may co-occur with negative emotions dur-
ing stressful situations, and they can provide some benefit. For example, positive emotions can
“undo” some of the ill effects of negative emotions, particularly the physiological effects
(Fredrickson & Levenson, 1998). In one study, people who expressed genuine smiling and
laughter when talking about their relationship with a spouse who had died 6 months earlier
had fewer grief-related symptoms and better relationships with others 2 years after the loss
(Keltner & Bonanno, 1997). Another study found that people who were able to find positive
meaning, such as spiritual growth or an appreciation of life, following a traumatic event were
able to respond to a laboratory stressor in a more adaptive fashion (Epel, McEwen, & Ickovics,
1998). A prospective study found that men with AIDS who reported experiencing more pos-
itive affect lived longer than men with AIDS who experienced less positive affect (Moskowitz,
2003). A review of several studies reported that older people in the community who experi-
ence higher levels of positive affect were more likely to live longer (Pressman & Cohen, 2005).
In addition, all people, regardless of age, who reported experiencing more positive affect had
better health in general.
Studies Using the COPE Scale The relationship between health and coping is most often
assessed by means of questionnaires that ask respondents to indicate how much they used var-
ious ways of coping to handle a recent stressor. One such measure, the COPE (Coping
Orientations to Problems Experienced) scale, is presented in Table 7.1.

As with the relationship between stress and health, the best way to examine links between
coping and health is by means of longitudinal study. Breast cancer, which strikes about one
woman in nine and is the second most deadly cancer among women (behind lung cancer),
has been investigated in this way. Breast cancer is a major stressor on many levels: it is life-
threatening; surgical interventions are often disfiguring and thus have serious implications
for psychological well-being; and both radiation therapy and chemotherapy often have very
unpleasant side effects.
In one study, the coping methods of women who had just been diagnosed with breast can-
cer were assessed several times during the year following the diagnosis (Carver et al., 1993).
Women who accepted their diagnosis and retained a sense of humor had lower levels of dis-
tress. Avoidant coping methods, such as denial and behavioral disengagement (see Table 7.1),
were associated with higher levels of distress, and this negative relationship between denial and
adjustment to breast cancer has been replicated (Heim, Valach, & Schaffner, 1997). Another
longitudinal study of several types of cancer found that avoidant coping (“I try not to think about
it”) predicted greater progression of the disease at a 1-year follow-up (Epping-Jordan, Compas,
& Howell, 1994). These results show that how a person reacts to a stressor is as crucial as the
stressor itself in predicting its physical and emotional effects. In the case of cancer, reducing
stress by ignoring the problem is not a good idea.
