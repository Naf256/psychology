The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a
publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) that provides a
common language and standard criteria for the classification and diagnosis of
mental disorders. While it's not possible to list every disorder outlined in
the DSM, I can give you a brief overview of some major categories and examples
of disorders included in the DSM-5 (the fifth edition published in 2013):

1. Neurodevelopmental Disorders: These disorders typically manifest in
childhood and involve developmental problems. Examples include autism
spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and
intellectual disability.

2. Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders: These disorders
involve disruptions in thinking, perception, and behavior. Schizophrenia
is the most well-known example, characterized by hallucinations, delusions,
disorganized thinking, and social withdrawal.

3. Bipolar and Related Disorders: These disorders involve significant mood
swings ranging from depressive episodes to manic or hypomanic episodes. Bipolar
disorder and cyclothymic disorder are examples.

4. Depressive Disorders: These disorders involve persistent feelings of
sadness, emptiness, and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. Major
depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) are
examples.

5. Anxiety Disorders: These disorders involve excessive fear or worry and can
cause significant distress. Examples include generalized anxiety disorder,
panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias.

6. Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders: These disorders
involve intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors
(compulsions). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and body dysmorphic
disorder are included in this category.

7. Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders: These disorders are associated
with exposure to traumatic or stressful events. Post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and acute stress disorder are examples.

8. Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: These disorders involve problems
with substance abuse or addiction. They include alcohol use disorder, opioid
use disorder, and stimulant use disorder.

9. Eating Disorders: These disorders involve disturbances in eating patterns
and body image. Examples include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and
binge-eating disorder.

10. Sleep-Wake Disorders: These disorders involve disruptions in sleep
patterns. Examples include insomnia disorder, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea.

Please note that this is just a brief overview, and the DSM-5 contains
many more disorders within various categories. Each disorder has specific
diagnostic criteria outlined in the manual.
