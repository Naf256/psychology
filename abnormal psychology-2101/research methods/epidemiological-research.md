Epidemiology is the study of the distribution of disorders in a
population. That is, data are gathered about the rates of a disorder
and its possible correlates in a large sample. Epidemiological research
focuses on three features of a disorder: 1. Prevalence. The proportion
of people with the disorder either currently or during their lifetime
2. Incidence. The proportion of people who develop new cases of the disorder
in some period, usually a year 3. Risk factor. Variables that are related
to the likelihood of developing the disorder Epidemiological studies of risk
factors are usually correlational studies because they examine how variables
relate to each other without including a manipulation of the independent
variable.  Epidemiological studies are designed to be representative of the
population being studied— researchers test a group of people who match
the population on key characteristics, like gen- der, economic status, and
ethnicity. Unfortunately, much of mental health research does not follow
these principles but rather draws on samples that are not representative. For
example, many studies use undergraduate samples. Undergraduates, though, are
likely to be wealthier and more educated than the general population. If
we only studied undergraduates with anx- iety disorders, we could end
up concluding that people with anxiety disorders are above aver- age in
intelligence. Other studies use samples drawn from treatment centers. But
people who seek treatment may be those with the more severe forms of
disorders. For example, estimates of suicide rates for a given disorder are
much higher when measured in hospitalized samples as compared to rates in
representative community samples. These types of bias can skew our perceptions
of factors related to mental disorders. Epidemiological studies, then,
are needed to carefully identify risk variables and outcomes for disorders.

The National Comorbidity Survey–Replication is an example of one large-scale
national sur- vey that used structured interviews to collect information on
the prevalence of several diagnoses (Kessler, Berglund et al., 2005). Table
4.4 shows some data from this study. The table presents lifetime prevalence
rates—the proportion of people who experienced a disorder during their
lifetime. From the table, we can see that major depression, alcoholism, and
anxiety disorders are very common—so common, in fact, that as many as half
(46.4 percent) of the people in the United States describe meeting criteria
for a mental disorder at some point during their lives.  Knowing that mental
disorders will strike one out of every two people should help reduce stigma.
People who experience the disorders may take comfort in knowing that so many
other people struggle with similar issues.  Knowledge about risk factors may
give clues to the causes of disorders. For example, depres- sion is about
twice as common in women as in men. Thus, gender is a risk factor for depres-
sion. In Chapter 8, we will review theories about this gender difference. The
results of epidemiological research may inform us about risk factors (like
gender and social class) that can be more thoroughly investigated using
other research methods.
