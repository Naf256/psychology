## Definition of Normality and Abnormality -

The terms "normality" and "abnormality" in behavior refer to the extent to which
an individual's behavior, thoughts, and emotions conform to societal and
cultural norms and expectations.

Normality refers to behavior that is typical or expected within a given society
or cultural context. This includes behaviors that are considered healthy,
adaptive, and functional. For example, in most cultures, it is considered normal
to seek social connection, experience a range of emotions, and engage in
productive activities such as work or study.

Abnormality, on the other hand, refers to behavior that deviates from the norm
and is considered atypical or maladaptive. This can include behaviors that are
harmful, dysfunctional, or impair an individual's ability to function
effectively in society. Examples of abnormal behavior may include substance
abuse, extreme anxiety or depression, or delusional thinking.

It's important to note that the concepts of normality and abnormality are not
always clear-cut and can be influenced by cultural, societal, and personal
factors. Additionally, labeling behavior as abnormal can be stigmatizing and may
lead to negative consequences for individuals who are struggling with mental
health issues. Therefore, it's important to approach these concepts with
sensitivity and nuance.

## Characteristics to abnormal behavior -

#### Statistical Infrequency -

One aspect of abnormal behavior is that it is infrequent. For example, episodes
of mania and depression is a type of experience that occur only in 1% of
population. The normal curve, or the bell-shaped curve, places the majority of
the people in the middle. Very few people fall at either extreme. An Assertion
that a person is normal implies that He or she does not deviate much from the
average in a particular trait or behavioral pattern.

Although some infrequent behavior do strike us as abnormal but they are not
considered as a part in the field of abnormal psychology. For example, Having
great athletic skills is infrequent, so is going through deep depression.
However, the later one is only considered to be abnormal behavior.

#### Violation of Norms -

When determining abnormality one thing to consider is that whether or not the
behavior violates social norms or threatens those observing it.

In addition, cultural diversity can affect how people view social norms--what is
norm in one culture may be abnormal is another.

Violation of norms explicitly makes abnormality a relative concept. Various
forms of unusual behavior can be tolerated, depending on the prevailing cultural
norms.

#### Personal distress -

Another characteristic of some form of abnormality is personal suffering, that
is behavior is abnormal if it creates great distress or torment to the person
experiencing it. Personal distress clearly fits many of the forms of abnormality
that is considered in the field of psychology. People experiencing anxiety
disorder of depression truly suffer greatly. The psychopaths for example, treats
others cold heartedly and may continually violate the law without experiencing
any guilt, remorse or anxiety whatsoever. And not all form of distress for
example, pain of child birth or hunger seem to belong to this field.

#### Disability or disfunction -

Dysfunction is one of the common characteristics associated with abnormality.
Dysfunction refers to the idea that abnormal behavior or thoughts can interfere
with a person's ability to function effectively in their daily life. This may
include difficulties with work, relationships, or other aspects of daily living.
For example, someone who is experiencing depression or anxiety may have
difficulty concentrating at work, or may withdraw from social interactions with
friends and family, which can impact their relationships and daily activities.
Additionally, someone who is experiencing addiction may have difficulty
fulfilling responsibilities at work or home, which can lead to negative
consequences and further dysfunction. Dysfunction can be a key indicator of
abnormality because it suggests that the behavior or thoughts are causing
significant impairment or distress in the person's life, and may require
treatment or intervention to address.

#### Unexpectedness -

Unexpectedness is another characteristic that can be associated with
abnormality. This refers to the idea that abnormal behavior or thoughts may be
unexpected or unusual in a given context, and may not be easily explained or
predicted by typical or commonly observed patterns of behavior. For example, if
someone suddenly starts experiencing intense anxiety or panic attacks in
situations where they previously felt comfortable and confident, this may be
seen as unexpected and abnormal. Similarly, if someone begins to exhibit
behaviors or thoughts that are outside of their typical personality or
character, this may be seen as unexpected and abnormal. The idea of
unexpectedness is often considered in conjunction with other characteristics of
abnormality, such as deviance, dysfunction, distress, and danger, to form a more
comprehensive understanding of abnormal behavior.
