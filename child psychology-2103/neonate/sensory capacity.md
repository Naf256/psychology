Just after Kaita was born, her father was certain that she looked directly
at him. Did she, in fact, see him?  This is a hard question to answer for
several reasons. For one thing, when sensory experts talk of “seeing,”
they mean both a sensory reaction due to the stimulation of the visual
sensory organs and an interpretation of that stimulation (the distinction,
as you might recall from an introductory psychology class, between sensation
and perception). As we’ll discuss further when we consider sensory
capabilities during infancy in Chapter 5, it is tricky, to say the least,
to pinpoint the specific sensory skills of newborns who lack the ability
to explain what they are experiencing.  Still, we do have some answers to
the question of what newborns are capable of seeing and, for that matter,
to questions about their other sensory capabilities. For ex- ample, it is
clear that neonates such as Kaita can see to some extent. Although their
visual acuity is not fully developed, newborns actively pay attention to
certain types of information in their environment.  For instance, neonates
pay closest attention to portions of scenes in their field of vision that
are highest in information, such as objects that sharply contrast with the
rest of their environment. Furthermore, infants can discriminate different
levels of brightness. There is even evidence suggesting that newborns have
a sense of size constancy. They seem aware that objects stay the same size
even though the size of the image on the retina varies with distance (Chien
et al., 2006; Braddick & Atkinson, 2011).  In addition, not only can newborn
babies distinguish different colors, but also they seem to prefer particular
ones. For example, they are able to distinguish among red, green, yellow, and
blue, and they take more time staring at blue and green objects—suggesting
a partiality for those colors (Dobson, 2000; Alexander & Hines, 2002; Zemach,
Chang, & Teller, 2007).  Newborns are also clearly capable of hearing. They
react to certain kinds of sounds, showing startle reactions to loud, sudden
noises, for instance. They also exhibit familiarity with certain sounds. For
example, a crying newborn will continue to cry when he or she hears other
newborns crying. If the baby hears a recording of its own crying, on the
other hand, he or she is more likely to stop crying, as if recognizing the
familiar sound (Dondi, Simion, & Caltran, 1999; Fernald, 2001).  As with
vision, however, the degree of auditory acuity is not as great as it will be
later. The auditory system is not completely developed. Moreover, amniotic
fluid, which is initially trapped in the middle ear, must drain out before
the newborn can fully hear. In addition to sight and hear- ing, the other
senses also function quite adequately in the newborn. It is obvious that
newborns are sensitive to touch. For instance, they respond to stimuli such
as the hairs of a brush, and they are aware of puffs of air so weak that
adults cannot notice them (see the Neuroscience and Devel- opment box to
learn about the long-term effects of an infant’s experience of pain).
The senses of smell and taste are also well developed. Newborns suck and
increase other physical activity when the odor of peppermint is placed near
the nose. They also pucker their lips when a sour taste is placed on them,
and respond with suitable facial expressions to other tastes as well. Such
findings clearly indicate that the senses of touch, smell, and taste not
only are present at birth but also are reasonably sophisticated (Cohen &
Cashon, 2003; Armstrong et al., 2007).  In one sense, the sophistication of
the sensory systems of newborns such as Kaita is not surprising. After all,
the typical neonate has had nine months to prepare for his or her encoun-
ter with the outside world. As we discussed in Chapter 3, human sensory
systems begin their development well before birth. Furthermore, the passage
through the birth canal may place babies in a state of heightened sensory
awareness, preparing them for the world that they are about to encounter
for the first time.
