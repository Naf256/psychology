Relatives gathered around the infant car seat and its occupant, Kaita
Castro. Born just two days ago, this is Kaita’s first day home from the
hospital with her mother. Kaita’s nearest cousin, 4-year-old Tabor, seems
uninterested in the new arrival. “Babies can’t do anything fun. They
can’t even do anything at all,” he says.  Kaita’s cousin Tabor is partly
right. There are many things babies cannot do. Neonates arrive in the world
quite incapable of successfully caring for themselves, for example. Why
are hu- man infants born so dependent, whereas members of other species
seem to arrive much better equipped for their lives?  One reason is that,
in one sense, humans are born too soon. The brain of the average newborn is
just one fourth of what it will be at adulthood. In comparison, the brain of
the macaque monkey, which is born after just 24 weeks of gestation, is 65% of
its adult size. Be- cause of the relative puniness of the infant human brain,
some observers have suggested that we are propelled out of the womb some 6 to
12 months sooner than we ought to be.  In reality, evolution probably knew
what it was doing: If we stayed inside our mothers’ bodies an additional
half-year to a year, our heads would be so large that we’d never manage to
get through the birth canal (Schultz, 1969; Gould, 1977; Kotre & Hall, 1990).
The relatively underdeveloped brain of the human newborn helps explain the
infant’s ap- parent helplessness. Because of this, the earliest views of
newborns focused on the things that they could not do, comparing them rather
unfavorably to older members of the human species.  Today, however, such
beliefs have taken a backseat to more favorable views of the neo- nate. As
developmental researchers have begun to understand more about the nature of
new- borns, they have come to realize that infants enter this world with an
astounding array of capabilities in all domains of development: physical,
cognitive, and social.

The world faced by a neonate is remarkably different from the one it
experienced in the womb.  Consider, for instance, the significant changes
in functioning that Kaita Castro encountered as she began the first moments
of life in her new environment (summarized in Table 4-4).  Kaita’s most
immediate task was to bring sufficient air into her body. Inside her mother,
air was delivered through the umbilical cord, which also provided a means for
taking away carbon dioxide. The realities of the outside world are different:
Once the umbilical cord was cut, Kaita’s respiratory system needed to
begin its lifetime’s work.  For Kaita, the task was automatic. As we noted
earlier, most newborn babies begin to breathe on their own as soon as they are
exposed to air. The ability to breathe immediately is a good indication that
the respiratory system of the normal neonate is reasonably well devel- oped,
despite its lack of rehearsal in the womb.  Neonates emerge from the uterus
more practiced in other types of physical activities. For example, newborns
such as Kaita show several reflexes—unlearned, organized, involuntary
responses that occur automatically in the presence of certain stimuli. Some
of these reflexes are well-rehearsed, having been present for several months
before birth. The sucking reflex and the swallowing reflex permit Kaita to
begin right away to ingest food. The rooting reflex, which involves turning
in the direction of a source of stimulation (such as a light touch) near the
mouth, is also related to eating. It guides the infant toward potential sources
of food that are near its mouth, such as a mother’s nipple.  Not all of the
reflexes that are present at birth lead the newborn to seek out desired stimuli
such as food. For instance, Kaita can cough, sneeze, and blink—reflexes that
help her to avoid stimuli that are potentially bothersome or hazardous. (We
discuss more reflexes in Chapter 5.)  Kaita’s sucking and swallowing
reflexes, which help her to consume her mother’s milk, are coupled with
the newfound ability to digest nutriments. The newborn’s digestive system
initially produces feces in the form of meconium, a greenish-black material
that is a remnant of the neonate’s days as a fetus.  Because the liver, a
critical component of the digestive system, does not always work effectively
at first, almost half of all newborns develop a distinctly yellowish tinge
to their bodies and eyes. This change in color is a symptom of neonatal
jaundice. It is most likely to occur in preterm and low-weight neonates,
and it is typically not dangerous. Treatment most often consists of placing
the baby under fluorescent lights or administering medicine.
