The Case Study The case study, perhaps the most familiar method of observing
human behavior, involves recording detailed information about one person at
a time. The clinical cases described in the last chapter are examples of
case studies. A comprehensive case study would cover family his- tory and
background, medical history, educational background, jobs held, marital
history, and details concerning development, adjustment, personality,
the current social environment, and experiences in therapy across the life
course.  Case studies lack the control and objectivity of other research
methods. That is, the valid- ity of the information gathered in a case study
is sometimes questionable. The objectivity of case studies is limited because
the clinician’s paradigm will shape the kinds of information reported in
a case study. To take one example, case studies by psychodynamic clinicians
typi- cally contain more information about the client’s early childhood and
parental conflicts than do reports by behavioral clinicians.  Despite their
relative lack of control, case studies still play an important role in
the study of abnormal behavior. Specifically, the case study can be used:
1. To provide a rich description of a clinical phenomenon 2. To disprove an
allegedly universal hypothesis 3. To generate hypotheses that can be tested
through controlled research

We discuss each of these uses next.  The Case Study as a Rich Description
Because it focuses on a single person, the case study can include much
more detail than other research methods typically do. This is particu-
larly helpful when a report covers a rare clinical phenomenon. Another
typical use is to pro- vide a detailed description of how a new intervention
works. See Focus on Discovery 4.2 for an example of the level of detail that
can be gathered within a case study.  The Case Study Can Disprove but Not
Prove a Hypothesis Case histories can pro- vide examples that contradict
an assumed universal relationship. Consider, for example, the proposition
that depressive episodes are always preceded by life stress. Finding even
a single case of non-stress-related depression would negate the theory.
Even though case studies can disprove a hypothesis, case studies do not
provide good evidence in support of a particular theory, because they do
not provide a way to rule out alternative hypotheses. To illustrate this
problem, consider the sleep/wake intervention described in Focus on Discovery
4.2. Although it would be tempting to conclude that the therapy is effective,
such a conclusion cannot be drawn legitimately because other factors could
have produced the change. A stressful situation in the client’s life
may have resolved, or the client may have adopted better coping skills
during the time period of the interven- tion. Thus, several plausible rival
hypotheses could account for the clinical improvement.  The data yielded
by the case study do not allow us to determine the true cause of the change.
Generating Hypotheses Although the case study may not provide valid support for
hypotheses, it does help generate hypotheses. As they hear the life histories
of many different clients, clinicians may notice patterns and then formulate
important hypotheses that they could not have formed otherwise. For example,
in his clinical work, Kanner (1943) noticed that some disturbed children
showed a similar constellation of symptoms, including failure to develop
lan- guage and extreme isolation from other people. He therefore proposed
a new diagnosis—infan- tile autism—that was subsequently confirmed by
larger-scale research and adopted into the DSM (see p. 450).
