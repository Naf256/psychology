Without intending to and without being aware of it, infants and children develop a sense of
how often different stimuli are found together simultaneously. This permits them to develop
an understanding of concepts, categorizations of objects, events, or people that share com-
mon properties. For example, by encoding the information that four legs, a wagging tail,
and barking are often found together, we learn very early in life to understand the concept of
“dog.” Children—as well as adults—are rarely aware of how they learn such concepts, and
they are often unable to articulate the features that distinguish one concept (such as a dog)
from another (such as cat). Instead, learning tends to occur automatically.
Some of the things we learn automatically are unexpectedly complex. For example, in-
fants have the ability to learn subtle statistical patterns and relationships; these results are
consistent with a growing body of research showing that the mathematical skills of infants
are surprisingly good. Infants as young as 5 months are able to calculate the outcome of
simple addition and subtraction problems. In a study by developmental psychologist Karen
Wynn, infants first were shown an object—a 4-inch-high Mickey Mouse statuette (see
Figure 7-2 on page 194). A screen was then raised, hiding the statuette. Next, the experi-
menter showed the infants a second, identical Mickey Mouse, and then placed it behind the
same screen (Wynn, 1995, 2000).
Depending on the experimental condition, one of two outcomes occurred. In the “correct
addition” condition, the screen dropped, revealing the two statuettes (analogous to 1 + 1 = 2).
But in the “incorrect addition” condition, the screen
dropped to reveal just one statuette (analogous to the in-
correct 1 + 1 = 1).
Because infants look longer at unexpected occur-
rences than at expected ones, the researchers examined
the pattern of infants’ gazes under the different condi-
tions. In support of the notion that infants can distinguish
between correct and incorrect addition, the infants in the
experiment gazed longer at the incorrect result than at the
correct one, indicating they expected a different number
of statuettes. In a similar procedure, infants also looked
longer at incorrect subtraction problems than at correct
ones. The conclusion: Infants have rudimentary math-
ematical skills that enable them to understand whether or
not a quantity is accurate.
The results of this growing body of research suggest
that infants have an innate grasp of certain basic math-
ematical functions and statistical patterns. This inborn
proficiency is likely to form the basis for learning more
complex mathematics and statistical relationships later in
life
