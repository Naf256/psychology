Infancy refers to the earliest stage of human life, typically starting from
birth and extending up to the age of two years. It is a critical period
characterized by rapid growth and development, during which infants undergo
significant physical, cognitive, emotional, and social changes.

During infancy, babies are completely dependent on their caregivers for
their basic needs, such as nourishment, comfort, and protection. They are
unable to communicate effectively through language and rely on crying and
other non-verbal cues to express their needs and emotions.

Infancy is a crucial time for brain development, as the neural connections
in the brain are rapidly forming and being refined. Sensory experiences and
interactions with the environment play a vital role in shaping a child's
cognitive abilities and emotional well-being during this period.

As infants grow and develop, they acquire various skills, such as grasping
objects, crawling, standing, and eventually walking. They also start to develop
their language skills, understanding and producing simple words and phrases.

Overall, infancy is a foundational stage in human life that lays the groundwork
for future physical, cognitive, and emotional development. Proper care and
nurturing during this stage are essential for the child's overall well-being
and future growth.
