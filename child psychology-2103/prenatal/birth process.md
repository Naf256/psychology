About 266 days after conception, a protein called corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH) triggers the release of various hormones, and the process that
leads to birth begins. One criti- cal hormone is oxytocin, which is released
by the mother’s pituitary gland. When the concen- tration of oxytocin becomes
high enough, the mother’s uterus begins periodic contractions (Heterelendy &
Zakar, 2004; Terzidou, 2007).  During the prenatal period, the uterus, which is
composed of muscle tissue, slowly ex- pands as the fetus grows. Although for
most of the pregnancy it is inactive, after the fourth month it occasionally
contracts to ready itself for the eventual delivery. These contractions,
called Braxton-Hicks contractions, are sometimes called “false labor”
because, while they can fool eager and anxious expectant parents, they do not
signify that the baby will be born soon.  When birth is actually imminent,
the uterus begins to contract intermittently. Its increas- ingly intense
contractions act as if it were a vise, opening and closing to force the head
of the fetus against the cervix, the neck of the uterus that separates it
from the vagina. Eventually, the force of the contractions becomes strong
enough to propel the fetus slowly down the birth canal until it enters the
world as a newborn. It is this exertion and the narrow birth passage- way
that often gives newborns the battered conehead appearance described earlier.
Labor proceeds in three stages (see Figure 4-1). In the first stage of labor,
the uterine contractions initially occur around every 8 to 10 minutes and last
about 30 seconds. As labor proceeds, the contractions occur more frequently
and last longer. Toward the end of labor, the contractions may occur every two
minutes and last almost two minutes. During the final part of the first stage
of labor, the contractions increase to their greatest intensity, a period known
as transition. The mother’s cervix fully opens, eventually expanding enough
(usually to around 10 cm) to allow the baby’s head (the widest part of the
body) to pass through.  This first stage of labor is the longest. Its duration
varies significantly, depending on the mother’s age, race, ethnicity, number
of prior pregnancies, and a variety of other factors involving both the fetus
and the mother. Typically, labor takes 16 to 24 hours for firstborn children,
but there are wide variations. Births of subsequent children usually involve
shorter periods of labor.  During the second stage of labor, which typically
lasts around 90 minutes, the baby’s head emerges further from the mother
with each contraction, increasing the size of the vagi- nal opening. Because
the area between the vagina and rectum must stretch a good deal, an incision
called an episiotomy is sometimes made to increase the size of the opening
of the vagina. However, this practice has been increasingly criticized in
recent years as potentially causing more harm than good, and the number of
episiotomies has fallen drastically in the last decades (Graham et al., 2005;
Dudding, Vaizey, & Kamm, 2008; Perrier et al., 2011).  The second stage of
labor ends when the baby has completely left the mother’s body.  Finally,
the third stage of labor occurs when the child’s umbilical cord (still
attached to the neonate) and the placenta are expelled from the mother. This
stage is the quickest and easiest, taking just a few minutes.  The nature of a
woman’s reactions to labor reflect, in part, cultural factors. Although there
is no evidence that the physiological aspects of labor differ among women of
different cultures, expectations about labor and interpretations of its pain
do vary significantly from one culture to another (Fisher, Hauck, & Fenwick,
2006; Xirasagar et al., 2011; Redshaw & Heikkilä, 2011).  For instance,
there is a kernel of truth to popular stories of pregnant women in certain
societies putting down the tools with which they are tilling their fields,
stepping aside and giving birth, and immediately returning to work with their
neonates wrapped and bundled on their backs. Accounts of the !Kung people in
Africa describe the woman in labor sitting calmly beside a tree and without
much ado—or assistance—successfully giving birth to a child and quickly
recovering. On the other hand, many societies regard childbirth as danger- ous,
and some even view it in terms befitting an illness. Such cultural perspectives
color the way that people in a given society view the experience of childbirth.
