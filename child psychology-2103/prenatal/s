The prenatal period consists of three phases: germinal, embryonic, and fetal. They are sum-
marized in Table 3-5.

The Germinal Stage: Fertilization to 2 Weeks. In the germinal stage, the first—
and shortest—stage of the prenatal period, the zygote begins to divide and grow in complex-
ity during the first 2 weeks following conception. During the germinal stage, the fertilized
egg (now called a blastocyst) travels toward the uterus, where it becomes implanted in the
uterus’s wall, which is rich in nutrients. The germinal stage is characterized by methodical
cell division, which gets off to a quick start: Three days after fertilization, the organism con-
sists of some 32 cells, and by the next day the number doubles. Within a week, it is made up
of 100 to 150 cells, and the number rises with increasing rapidity.
In addition to increasing in number, the cells of the organism become increasingly spe-
cialized. For instance, some cells form a protective layer around the mass of cells, whereas
others begin to establish the rudiments of a placenta and umbilical cord. When fully devel-
oped, the placenta serves as a conduit between the mother and fetus, providing nourishment
and oxygen via the umbilical cord. In addition, waste materials from the developing child are
removed through the umbilical cord.

The Embryonic Stage: 2 Weeks to 8 Weeks. By the end of the germinal period—
just 2 weeks after conception—the organism is firmly secured to the wall of the mother’s
uterus. At this point, the child is called an embryo. The embryonic stage is the period from
2 to 8 weeks following fertilization. One of the highlights of this stage is the development of
the major organs and basic anatomy.
At the beginning of the embryonic stage, the developing child has three distinct layers,
each of which will ultimately form a different set of structures as development proceeds. The
outer layer of the embryo, the ectoderm, will form skin, hair, teeth, sense organs, and the
brain and spinal cord. The endoderm, the inner layer, produces the digestive system, liver,
pancreas, and respiratory system. Sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm is the
mesoderm, from which the muscles, bones, blood and circulatory system are forged. Every
part of the body is formed from these three layers.
If you were looking at an embryo at the end of the embryonic stage, you might be hard-
pressed to identify it as human. Only an inch long, an 8-week-old embryo has what appear
to be gills and a tail-like structure. On the other hand, a closer look reveals several familiar
features. Rudimentary eyes, nose, lips, and even teeth can be recognized, and the embryo has
stubby bulges that will form arms and legs.
The head and brain undergo rapid growth during the embryonic period. The head begins
to represent a significant proportion of the embryo’s size, encompassing about 50% of its
total length. The growth of nerve cells, called neurons, is astonishing: As many as 100,000
neurons are produced every minute during the second month of life! The nervous system
begins to function around the 5th week, and weak brain waves begin to be produced as the
nervous system starts to function (Nelson & Bosquet, 2000).

The Fetal Stage: 8 Weeks to Birth. It is not until the final period of prenatal develop-
ment, the fetal stage, that the developing child becomes easily recognizable. The fetal stage
starts at about 8 weeks after conception and continues until birth. The fetal stage formally
starts when the differentiation of the major organs has occurred.
Now called a fetus, the developing child undergoes astoundingly rapid change
during the fetal stage. For instance, it increases in length approximately 20 times, and
its proportions change dramatically. At 2 months, approximately one half of the fetus is
what will ultimately be its head; by 5 months, the head accounts for just over one-fourth
of its total size (see ­Figure 3-13). The fetus also substantially increases in weight. At
4 months, the fetus weighs an average of about 4 ounces; at 7 months, it weighs about
3 pounds; and at the time of birth the average child weighs just over 7 pounds.
At the same time, the developing child is rapidly becoming more complex. Or-
gans become more differentiated and start to work. By 3 months, for example, the
fetus swallows and urinates. In addition, the interconnections between the different
parts of the body become more complex and integrated. Arms develop hands; hands
develop fingers; fingers develop nails.
As this is happening, the fetus makes itself known to the outside world. In the ear-
liest stages of pregnancy, mothers may be unaware that they are, in fact, pregnant. As
the fetus becomes increasingly active, however, most mothers certainly take notice. By
4 months, a mother can feel the movement of her child, and several months later others
can feel the baby’s kicks through the mother’s skin. In addition to the kicks that alert
its mother to its presence, the fetus can turn, do somersaults, cry, hiccup, clench its fist,
open and close its eyes, and suck its thumb.
The brain becomes increasingly sophisticated during the fetal stage. The two
symmetrical left and right halves of the brain, known as hemispheres, grow rapidly,
and the interconnections between neurons become more complex. The neurons be
come coated with an insulating material called myelin which helps speed the trans-
mission of messages from the brain to the rest of the body.
By the end of the fetal period, brain waves are produced that indicate the fetus passes
through different stages of sleep and wakefulness. The fetus is also able to hear (and feel the
vibrations of) sounds to which it is exposed. For instance, researchers Anthony DeCasper and
Melanie Spence (1986) asked a group of pregnant mothers to read aloud the Dr. Seuss story The
Cat in the Hat two times a day during the latter months of pregnancy. Three days after the babies
were born, they appeared to recognize the story they had heard, responding more to it than to
another story that had a different rhythm.
In weeks 8 to 24 following conception, hormones are released that lead to the increasing differ-
entiation of male and female fetuses. For example, high levels of androgen are produced in males
that affect the size of brain cells and the growth of neural connections, which, some scientists spec-
ulate, ultimately may lead to differences in male and female brain structure and even later variations
in gender-related behavior (Knickmeyer & Baron-Cohen, 2006; Burton et al., 2009; Joel, 2011).
Just as no two adults are alike, no two fetuses are the same. Although development during
the prenatal period follows the broad patterns outlined here, there are significant differences in
the specific nature of individual fetuses’ behavior. Some fetuses are exceedingly active, whereas
others are more sedentary. (The more active fetuses will probably be more active after birth.)
Some have relatively quick heart rates, whereas others’ heart rates are slower, with the typical
range varying between 120 and 160 beats per minute (DiPietro et al., 2002; Niederhofer, 2004;
Such differences in fetal behavior are due in part to genetic characteristics inherited at the
moment of fertilization. Other kinds of differences, though, are brought about by the nature
of the environment in which the child spends its first 9 months of life. As we will see, there
are numerous ways in which the prenatal environment of infants affects their ­development—
in good ways and bad.
