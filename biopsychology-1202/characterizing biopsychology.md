Although biopsychology is only one of many disciplines
that contribute to neuroscience, it is broad and diverse.
Biopsychologists study many different phenomena, and
they approach their research in many different ways.
In order to characterize biopsychological research, this
module discusses three major dimensions along which
approaches to biopsychological research
vary. Biopsychological research can involve either human
or nonhuman subjects, it can take the form of either formal
experiments or nonexperimental studies,
and it can be either pure or applied.

## Human and Nonhuman Subjects
- Humans have several advantages
	over other animals as experimental sub-
	jects of biopsychological research: They
	can follow instructions, they can report
	their subjective experiences,

- Humans are often cheaper. Because only the highest
	standards of animal care are acceptable, the cost of
    maintaining an animal laboratory can be prohibitive 
    for all but the most well-funded researchers.
	
-  Of course, the greatest advantage humans have as subjects in a
    field aimed at understanding the intricacies of human brain 
    function is that they have human brains. The brains of
    humans differ from the brains of other mammals primarily 
    in their overall size and the extent of their cortical development.

- Conversely, nonhuman animals have three ad-
	vantages over humans as subjects in biopsychological
	research. The first is that the brains and behavior of
	nonhuman subjects are simpler than those of human
	subjects.
	
- The second advantage is that insights frequently arise
	from the comparative approach, the study of biological
	processes by comparing different species.
	
- The third
	advantage is that it is possible to conduct research on lab-
	oratory animals that, for ethical reasons, is not possible
	with human participants.

### Experiments and non-experiments
##### Experiments - 
The experiment is the method used
by scientists to study causation, that is, to find out what
causes what.
To conduct an ex-
periment involving living subjects, the experimenter first
designs two or more conditions under which the subjects
will be tested. Usually, a different group of subjects is
tested under each condition (between-subjects design),
but sometimes it is possible to test the same group of
subjects under each condition (within-subjects design).
any differences in the dependent variable between the
conditions must have been caused by the independent
variable

##### Quasi-experimental studies - 
It is not possible for
biopsychologists to bring the experimental method to bear
on all problems of interest to them
quasiex-
perimental studies—studies of groups of subjects who
have been exposed to the conditions of interest in the real
world. These studies have the appearance of experiments,
but they are not true experiments because potential con-
founded variables have not been controlled

##### Case studies -
Studies that focus on a single case or
subject are called case studies. Because they focus on a
single case, they often provide a more in-depth picture
than that provided by an experiment or a quasiexperi-
mental study, and they are an excellent source of testable
hypotheses. However, there is a major problem with all
case studies: their generalizability—the degree to which
their results can be applied to other cases.

##### Pure and applied research -
Biopsychological research can be either pure or applied.
Pure research and applied research differ in a number of
respects, but they are distinguished less by their own at-
tributes than by the motives of the individuals involved in
their pursuit. pure research is motivated primarily by the
curiosity of the researcher—it is done solely for the purpose
of acquiring knowledge. In contrast, applied research is
intended to bring about some direct benefit to humankind.
