Biopsychologists who take the same approaches to their
research tend to publish their research in the same journals,
attend the same scientific meetings, and belong to the same
professional societies. The particular approaches to bio-
psychology that have flourished and grown have gained
wide recognition as separate divisions of biopsychological
research. The purpose of this module of the chapter is to
give you a clearer sense of biopsychology and its diversity
by describing six of its major divisions

#### Physiological psychology -
physiological psychology is the division of biopsychology
that studies the neural mechanisms of behavior through
the direct manipulation and recording of the brain in con-
trolled experiments—surgical and electrical methods are
most common. The subjects of physiological psychology
research are almost always laboratory animals because
the focus on direct brain manipulation and controlled
experiments precludes the use of human participants in
most instances. There is also a tradition of pure research
in physiological psychology;

#### Psycopharmacology -
psychopharmacology is similar to physiological psychol-
ogy except that it focuses on the manipulation of neural
activity and behavior with drugs. In fact, many of the early
psychopharmacologists were simply physiological psy-
chologists who moved into drug research, and many of
today’s biopsychologists identify closely with
both approaches. However, the study of the
effects of drugs on the brain and behavior has
become so specialized that psychopharmacology is re-
garded as a separate discipline.
the purpose of many psychopharmacological experiments
is to develop therapeutic drugs (see Chapter 18) or to re-
duce drug abuse (see Chapter 15).

#### Neuropsychology -
neuropsychology is the study of the psychological ef-
fects of brain damage in human patients. Because human
volunteers cannot ethically be exposed to experimental
treatments that endanger normal brain function, neuro-
psychology deals almost exclusively with case studies
and quasiexperimental studies of patients with brain
damage resulting from disease, accident, or neurosur-
gery. The outer layer of the cerebral hemispheres—the
cerebral cortex—is most likely to be damaged by acci-
dent or surgery; this is one reason why neuropsychology
has focused on this important part of the human brain.
Neuropsychology is the most applied of the biopsy-
chological subdisciplines;

#### Psychophysiology -
psychophysiology is the division of biopsychology that
studies the relation between physiological activity and
psychological processes in human subjects. Because the
subjects of psychophysiological research are human, psy-
chophysiological recording procedures are typically non-
invasive; that is, the physiological activity is recorded from
the surface of the body. The usual measure of brain activity
is the scalp electroencephalogram (eeg) (see Chapter 5).
Other common psychophysiological measures are muscle
tension, eye movement, and several indicators of auto-
nomic nervous system activity (e.g., heart rate, blood
pressure, pupil dilation, and electrical conductance of the
skin).

#### Cognitive neuroscience -
Cognitive neuroscience is the youngest division of bio-
psychology. Cognitive neuroscientists study the neural
bases of cognition, a term that generally refers to higher
intellectual processes such as thought, memory, attention,
and complex perceptual processes (see Gutchess, 2014;
Raichle, 2008). Because of its focus on cognition, most
cognitive neuroscience research involves human partici-
pants,

#### Compararive psychology -
The division of biopsychology that deals generally with the
biology of behavior, rather than specifically with the neu-
ral mechanisms of behavior, is comparative psychology.
Comparative psychologists compare the behavior of differ-
ent species in order to understand the evolution, genetics,
and adaptiveness of behavior. Some comparative psychol-
ogists study behavior in the laboratory; others engage in
ethological research—the study of animal behavior in its
natural environment.
