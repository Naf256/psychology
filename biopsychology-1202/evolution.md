Darwin argued that evolution occurs through natural
selection (see Pritchard, 2010). He pointed out that the
members of each species vary greatly in their structure,
physiology, and behavior and that the heritable traits as-
sociated with high rates of survival and reproduction are
the most likely ones to be passed on to future generations
(see Kingsley, 2009). He argued that natural selection,

when repeated for generation after genera-
tion, leads to the evolution of species that
are better adapted to surviving and repro-
ducing in their particular environmental
niche. Darwin called this process natural
selection to emphasize its similarity to the
artificial selective breeding practices em-
ployed by breeders of domestic animals.
Just as horse breeders create faster horses
by selectively breeding the fastest of their
existing stock, nature creates fitter animals
by selectively breeding the fittest. fitness,
in the Darwinian sense, is the ability of
an organism to survive and contribute its
genes to the next generation.
The theory of evolution was at odds
with the various dogmatic views embedded
in the 19th-century zeitgeist, so it met with
initial resistance. Although resistance still
exists, virtually none comes from people
who understand the evidence (see Curry,
2009; Short & Hawley, 2015).
