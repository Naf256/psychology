Darwin argued that evolution occurs through natural
selection (see Pritchard, 2010). He pointed out that the
members of each species vary greatly in their structure,
physiology, and behavior and that the heritable traits as-
sociated with high rates of survival and reproduction are
the most likely ones to be passed on to future generations
(see Kingsley, 2009). He argued that natural selection,

when repeated for generation after genera-
tion, leads to the evolution of species that
are better adapted to surviving and repro-
ducing in their particular environmental
niche. Darwin called this process natural
selection to emphasize its similarity to the
artificial selective breeding practices em-
ployed by breeders of domestic animals.
Just as horse breeders create faster horses
by selectively breeding the fastest of their
existing stock, nature creates fitter animals
by selectively breeding the fittest. fitness,
in the Darwinian sense, is the ability of
an organism to survive and contribute its
genes to the next generation.
The theory of evolution was at odds
with the various dogmatic views embedded
in the 19th-century zeitgeist, so it met with
initial resistance. Although resistance still
exists, virtually none comes from people
who understand the evidence (see Curry,
2009; Short & Hawley, 2015).

Mutations are changes in the structure of the molecules that make up genes, called DNA. The mutation of genes is an important source of genetic variation within a population. Mutations can be random (for example, when replicating cells make an error while copying DNA), or happen as a result of exposure to something in the environment, like harmful chemicals or radiation.

Mutations can be harmful, neutral, or sometimes helpful, resulting in a new, advantageous trait. When mutations occur in germ cells (eggs and sperm), they can be passed on to offspring.

Isolation means that organisms of the same species are separated, and happens when there is something between the organisms that they can't cross. Organisms become isolated as a result of environmental change. The cause of isolation can be gradual, like when mountains or deserts form, or continents split apart. It can also be quick, such as organisms being blown to different places by a storm or tsunami (tidal waves).

When organisms become isolated the two groups are also not able to reproduce together, so variations and mutations that occur in one group are not necessarily found in the other group. The longer the groups are isolated, the more different they are. They eventually become different species. Moreover, if there is a change in the environment of one group it does not necessarily occur in the environment of the other. So they will evolve and adapt differently.

The finches and other organisms that Darwin found on the Galapagos Islands are examples that demonstrate the effect that environmental change and isolation can have on a species.


Genetic drift is change in allele frequencies in a population from generation to generation that occurs due to chance events. To be more exact, genetic drift is change due to "sampling error" in selecting the alleles for the next generation from the gene pool of the current generation. Although genetic drift happens in populations of all sizes, its effects tend to be stronger in small populations.

Allele benefit or harm doesn't matter
Genetic drift, unlike natural selection, does not take into account an alleleâ€™s benefit (or harm) to the individual that carries it. That is, a beneficial allele may be lost, or a slightly harmful allele may become fixed, purely by chance.
A beneficial or harmful allele would be subject to selection as well as drift, but strong drift (for example, in a very small population) might still cause fixation of a harmful allele or loss of a beneficial one.

The bottleneck effect
The bottleneck effect is an extreme example of genetic drift that happens when the size of a population is severely reduced. Events like natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, fires) can decimate a population, killing most individuals and leaving behind a small, random assortment of survivors.
The allele frequencies in this group may be very different from those of the population prior to the event, and some alleles may be missing entirely. The smaller population will also be more susceptible to the effects of genetic drift for generations (until its numbers return to normal), potentially causing even more alleles to be lost.
