### Overview of metabolism
Cells are constantly carrying out thousands of chemical reactions
needed to keep the cell, and your body as a whole, alive and
healthy. These chemical reactions are often linked together in
chains, or pathways. All of the chemical reactions that take place
inside of a cell are collectively called the cellâ€™s metabolism.

Metabolic pathways can be broadly divided into two categories based
on their effects. Photosynthesis, which builds sugars out of smaller
molecules, is a "building up," or anabolic, pathway. In contrast, 
cellular respiration breaks sugar down into smaller molecules and is
a "breaking down," or catabolic, pathway.

Anabolic pathways build complex molecules from simpler ones and
typically need an input of energy. Building glucose from carbon
dioxide is one example. Other examples include the synthesis of
proteins from amino acids, or of DNA strands from nucleic acid
building blocks (nucleotides). These biosynthetic processes are 
critical to the life of the cell, take place constantly, and use
energy carried by ATP and other short-term energy storage molecules.

Catabolic pathways involve the breakdown of complex molecules into 
simpler ones and typically release energy. Energy stored in the 
bonds of complex molecules, such as glucose and fats, is released
in catabolic pathways. It's then harvested in forms that can power
the work of the cell (for instance, through the synthesis of ATP)
