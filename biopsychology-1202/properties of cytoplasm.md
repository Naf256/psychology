### Properties of Cytoplasm
- The cytoplasm is made of 70% – 80% water and is usually colorless.
- It contains proteins, carbohydrates, salts, sugars, amino acids, and nucleotides.
- The cytoplasm constitutes of dissolved nutrients and also dissolved waste products.
- The outer clear and glassy layer of the cytoplasm is called the ectoplasm or the cell cortex and the inner granular mass is called the endoplasm.
- The peripheral zone of cytoplasm is a thick and jelly-like substance, known as the plasmogel. The surrounding area of the nuclear zone is thin and liquefied in nature and is known as the plasmosol. 
- The physical nature of the cytoplasm is variable. Sometimes, there is quick diffusion across the cell, making the cytoplasm resemble a colloidal solution. At other times, it appears to take on the properties of a gel-like or glass-like substance.
- It is said to have the properties of viscous as well as elastic materials – capable of deforming slowly under external force in addition to regaining its original shape with minimal loss of energy. 
- The cytoskeleton present in the cytoplasm gives the cell its shape.
- Cytoplasm helps the movement of the cellular materials around the cell through a process called cytoplasmic streaming.
Since the cytoplasm constitutes numerous salts, it is a very good conductor of electricity.  
- It shows differential staining properties, the areas stained with the basic dyes are the basophilic areas of the cytoplasm and is termed as ergatoplasm for this material.
