### Functions of the Cell Nucleus
The cell nucleus controls the hereditary characteristics of an organism. This organelle is also responsible for protein synthesis, growth, cell division, and differentiation. The important function is carried out by a cell nucleus. The following are the important functions of the nucleus summarised below.

- Chromatin is referred to as the storage of hereditary material, the genes in the form of long and thin DNA strands.

- The Nucleolus is referred to as the storage of proteins and RNA in the nucleolus.

- The Nucleus is a site for transcription in which messenger RNA is produced for protein synthesis.

- The nucleus functions as the exchange of hereditary molecules that is RNA and DNA between the nucleus and the rest of the cell.

- During cell division, chromatins are arranged into chromosomes in the nucleus.

- It functions in the production of ribosomes in the nucleolus.

- The nucleus functions the selective transportation of regulatory factors and energy molecules through nuclear pores.
