### Structure of the Nucleus

The cell nucleus consists of a nuclear membrane, called the nuclear envelope, nucleoplasm, nucleolus, and chromosomes. Nucleoplasm, also called karyoplasm, is the matrix present inside the nucleus. The nuclear membrane separates the constituents of the nucleus from the cytoplasm. Like the cell membrane, the nuclear envelope consists of phospholipids that form a lipid bilayer. The envelope helps to maintain the shape of the nucleus and assists in coordinating the flow of the molecules into and out of the nucleus through nuclear pores. The nucleus of the cell contains DNA. The DNA controls the form, function, and growth of the cell. The nucleus is similar to the brain in its functions of coordinating all the cell activities. The main components of the nuclear structure are discussed below.
