How Is Biopsychology Related to the
Other Disciplines of Neuroscience?

Neuroscience is a team effort, and biopsychologists are im-
portant members of the team (see Albright, Kandel, & Posner,
2000; Kandel & Squire, 2000). Biopsychology can be further
defined by its relation to other neuroscientific disciplines.
==Biopsychologists are neuroscientists who bring to
their research a knowledge of behavior and of the meth-
ods of behavioral research. ==It is their behavioral ori-
entation and expertise that make their contribution to
neuroscience unique (see Cacioppo & Decety, 2009). You
will be able to better appreciate the importance of this con-
tribution if you consider that the ultimate purpose of the
nervous system is to produce and control behavior (see
Grillner & Dickinson, 2002).
==Biopsychology is an integrative discipline==. Bio-
psychologists draw together knowledge from the other neu-
roscientific disciplines and apply it to the study of behavior.
The following are a few of the disciplines of neuroscience that
are particularly relevant to biopsychology (see Figure 1.2):

- **neuroanatomy:** The study of the structure of the ner-
 vous system 

- **neuropathology:** The study of nervous system disorders

- **neuropharmacology:**. The study of the effects of drugs
 on neural activity 

- **neurophysiology:** The study of the functions and ac-
 tivities of the nervous system 

- **neurochemistry:** The study of chemical basis of neural activity.

- **neuroendocrinology:** The study of interaction between nervous
 system and endocrine system.
