The membrane potential is the difference in
electrical charge between the inside and the outside of a cell.

To record a neuron’s membrane potential, it is necessary to
position the tip of one electrode inside the neuron and the
tip of another electrode outside the neuron in the extracel-
lular fluid. Although the size of the extracellular electrode
is not critical, it is paramount that the tip of the intracellu-
lar electrode be fine enough to pierce the neural membrane
without severely damaging it. The intracellular electrodes
are called microelectrodes; their tips are less than one-
thousandth of a millimeter in diameter—much too small
to be seen by the naked eye.

When both electrode tips are in the extracellular fluid,
the voltage difference between them is zero. However,
when the tip of the intracellular electrode is inserted into
a neuron, a steady potential of about −70 millivolts (mV)
is recorded. This indicates that the potential inside the
resting neuron is about 70 mV less than that outside the
neuron. This steady membrane potential of about −70
mV is called the neuron’s resting potential. In its resting
state, with the −70 mV charge built up across its mem-
brane, a neuron is said to be polarized.

Like all salts in solution, the salts in neural tissue sepa-
rate into positively and negatively charged particles
called ions. There are many different kinds of ions in
neurons, but this discussion focuses on only two of
them: sodium ions and potassium ions. The abbrevia-
tions for sodium ions (Na+) and potassium ions (K+) are
derived from their Latin names: natrium (Na) and kalium
(K). The plus signs indicate that each Na+ and K+ ion car-
ries a single positive charge.
In resting neurons, there are more Na+ ions outside
the cell than inside and more K+ ions inside than outside.
These unequal distributions of Na+ and K+ ions are main-
tained even though there are specialized pores, called ion
channels, in neural membranes through which ions can
pass. Each type of ion channel is specialized for the pas-
sage of particular ions (e.g., Na+ or K+).
There is substantial pressure on Na+ ions to enter the
resting neurons. This pressure is of two types. First is the
electrostatic pressure from the resting membrane potential:
Because opposite charges attract, the -70 mV charge at-
tracts the positively charged Na+ ions into resting neurons.
Second is the pressure from random motion for Na+ ions to
move down their concentration gradient. Let us explain. Like
all ions in solution, the ions in neural tissue are in constant
random motion, and particles in random motion tend to
become evenly distributed because they are more likely to
move down their concentration gradients than up them; that
is, they are more likely to move from areas of high concen-
tration to areas of low concentration than vice versa.
So, why then do Na+ ions under electrostatic pressure
and pressure from random movement not come rushing
into neurons, thus reducing the resting membrane poten-
tial? The answer is simple: The sodium ion channels in
resting neurons are closed, thus greatly reducing the flow
of Na+ ions into the neuron. In contrast, the potassium
channels are open in resting neurons, but only a few K+
ions exit because they are largely held inside by the nega-
tive resting membrane potential.
In the 1950s, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley
became interested in the stability of the resting membrane
potential. Some Na+ ions do manage to enter resting neu-
rons despite the closed sodium channels and some K+ ions
do exit; then why does the resting membrane potential
stay fixed? In a series of clever experiments, for which they
were awarded Nobel Prizes, Hodgkin and Huxley discov-
ered the answer. At the same rate that Na+ ions leaked into
resting neurons, other Na+ ions were actively transported
out; and at the same rate that K+ ions leaked out of rest-
ing neurons, other K+ ions were actively transported in.
Such ion transport is performed by mechanisms in the cell
membrane that continually exchange three Na+ ions inside
the neuron for two K+ ions outside. These transporters are
commonly referred to as sodium–potassium pumps.
