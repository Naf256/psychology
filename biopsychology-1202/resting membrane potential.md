To record a neuron’s membrane potential, it is necessary to
position the tip of one electrode inside the neuron and the
tip of another electrode outside the neuron in the extracel-
lular fluid. Although the size of the extracellular electrode
is not critical, it is paramount that the tip of the intracellu-
lar electrode be fine enough to pierce the neural membrane
without severely damaging it. The intracellular electrodes
are called microelectrodes; their tips are less than one-
thousandth of a millimeter in diameter—much too small
to be seen by the naked eye.
When both electrode tips are in the extracellular fluid,
the voltage difference between them is zero. However,
when the tip of the intracellular electrode is inserted into
a neuron, a steady potential of about −70 millivolts (mV)
is recorded. This indicates that the potential inside the
resting neuron is about 70 mV less than that outside the
neuron. This steady membrane potential of about −70
mV is called the neuron’s resting potential. In its resting
state, with the −70 mV charge built up across its mem-
brane, a neuron is said to be polarized.
